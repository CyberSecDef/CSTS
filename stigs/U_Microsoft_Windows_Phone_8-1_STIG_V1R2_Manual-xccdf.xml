In many cases, the user may falsely believe that the device is connected to an authorized network and then provide authentication credentials and other sensitive information. A strong bidirectional, cryptographically based authentication method over VPN mitigates this risk. A VPN can be configured to time out when idle, which, depending on the configuration for a triggered connection, might enable scenarios where the VPN is not on and unprotected access to the Internet is possible. Requiring the VPN connection to be Always On ensures that the VPN is at all times protecting and securing traffic.

For Windows Phone 8.1, this configuration supports the DoD requirement that applications cannot access or store data to cloud storage services.

For Windows Phone 8.1, this requirement is needed to prevent access to cloud services like OneDrive by OS applications and components such as:

Office Hub/Applications
