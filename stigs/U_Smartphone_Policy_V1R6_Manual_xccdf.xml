This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) smartphones and tablets.

This requirement also applies to sensitive DoD information stored on mobile OS devices that are not authorized to connect to DoD networks or store/process sensitive DoD information. Sensitive DoD data or information is defined as any data/information that has not been approved for public release by the site/Command Public Affairs Officer (PAO).

In accordance with DoD policy, all components must establish Incident Handling and Response procedures. A CMI or “data spill” occurs when a classified email is inadvertently sent on an unclassified network and received on a wireless email device. Classified information may also be transmitted through some other form of file transfer to include web browser downloads and files transferred through tethered connections. Smartphones are not authorized for processing classified data. 

A data spill also occurs if a classified document is attached to an otherwise unclassified email. For this case, on a smartphone, a data spill will only occur if the classified attached document is viewed or opened by the smartphone user since the smartphone system only downloads an attachment on the smartphone if the user views or opens the attachment. The site's Incident Handling and Response procedures should reference NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12, Section 5, for smartphone destruction procedures. 

Check Procedures: 
Interview the IAO. Verify classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are documented in site smartphone procedures or security policies. Mark as a finding if classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are not documented in site smartphone procedures or security policies.

This requirement applies at both sites where smartphones are issued and managed and at sites where the smartphone management server is located.

---At the smartphone management server site, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions to sanitize the smartphone management server and email servers (e.g., Exchange, Oracle mail). 

---At smartphone sites, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions for incident reporting and actions to safeguard classified smartphone devices. The following actions will be followed for all smartphones involved in a data spill:

-BlackBerry smartphones: follow procedures in the DoD Data Spill Procedures Guide for BlackBerry Smartphones located at http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/net_perimeter/wireless/smartphone.html. 

-Windows Mobile, Android, and iOS smartphones: the smartphone will be destroyed.

Mark as a finding if Incident Handling and Response procedures do not include required information.

Sensitive DoD data or information is defined as any data/information that has not been approved for public release by the site/Command Public Affairs Officer (PAO).

If a data spill occurs on a smartphone, the following actions must be completed: 

- The smartphone management server and email servers (i.e., Exchange, Oracle mail, etc.) are handled as classified systems until they are sanitized according to appropriate procedures. (See NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12 for sanitization procedures.)

- The smartphone is handled as a classified device and destroyed according to DoD guidance for destroying classified equipment or sanitized as directed in Check WIR-SPP-003-01.

Check Procedures: 
Interview the IAO. Determine if the site has had a data spill within the previous 24 months. If yes, review written records, incident reports, and/or after action reports and determine if required procedures were followed. 

Mark as a finding if the site had a data spill within the previous 24 months and required procedures were not followed.

Prior to disposing of a smartphone (for example, if the smartphone is transferred to another DoD or government agency), follow the disposal procedures found in the STIG/ISCG Technology Overview document of the STIG/ISCG for the smartphone of interest. For example, look in the BlackBerry Overview document in the BlackBerry STIG for the disposal procedures for a BlackBerry smartphone or the Windows Mobile Overview in the Good Mobile Messaging STIG for the disposal procedures for a Windows Mobile smartphone. 

Interview the IAO. 

Verify proper procedures are being followed and the procedures are documented. 

Check to see how retired, discarded, or transitioned smartphones were disposed of during the previous 6 – 12 months and verify compliance with requirements. 

Note: The site can find disposal procedures listed in the smartphone STIG/ISCG.

This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) smartphones and tablets.

The site (location where smartphones are issued and managed and the site where the smartphone management server is located) must publish procedures to follow if a smartphone has been lost or stolen. The procedures should include (as appropriate):

-Smartphone user notifies IAO, SM, and other site personnel, as required by the site’s Incident Response Plan, within the timeframe required by the site’s Incident Response Plan. 

-The IAO notifies the smartphone management server system administrator and other site personnel, as required by the site’s Incident Response Plan, within the timeframe required by the site’s Incident Response Plan. 

The site smartphone management server administrator sends a wipe command to the smartphone and then disables the user account on the management server or removes the smartphone from the user account.
