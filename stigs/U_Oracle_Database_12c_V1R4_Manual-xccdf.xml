For example, if user1 starts the listener, then only user1 can administer it. Any other user trying to administer the listener gets an error. The super user is the only exception.

Remote administration of the listener must not be permitted. If listener administration from a remote system is required, granting secure remote access to the Oracle DBMS server and performing local administration is preferred. Authorize and document this requirement in the System Security Plan.

Note: In Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1), the listener password feature is no longer supported. This does not cause a loss of security because authentication is enforced through local operating system authentication.

Note:  This check needs to be done only once per host system and once per listener. Multiple listeners may be defined on a single host system. They must all be reviewed, but only once per database home review.

For subsequent database home reviews on the same host system, this check is not a finding.

Determine all Listeners running on the host.

For Windows hosts, view all Windows services with TNSListener embedded in the service name
  - The service name format is:
      Oracle[ORACLE_HOME_NAME]TNSListener

For UNIX hosts, the Oracle Listener process will indicate the TNSLSNR executable.

At a command prompt, issue the command:
  ps -ef | grep tnslsnr | grep -v grep

The alias for the listener follows tnslsnr in the command output.

Must be logged on the host system using the account that owns the tnslsnr executable (UNIX). If the account is denied local logon, have the system SA assist in this task by adding 'su' to the listener account from the root account. On Windows platforms, log on using an account with administrator privileges to complete the check.

From a system command prompt, execute the listener control utility:

  lsnrctl status [LISTENER NAME]

Review the results for the value of Security.

If "Security = OFF" is displayed, this is a finding.

If "Security = ON: Local OS Authentication" is displayed, this is not a finding.

If "Security = ON: Password or Local OS Authentication", this is a finding (do not set a password on Oracle versions 10.1 and higher. Instead, use Local OS Authentication).

Repeat the execution of the lsnrctl utility for all active listeners.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-61443"><title>SRG-APP-000516-DB-999900</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-75933r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O121-BP-022800</version><title>Application role permissions must not be assigned to the Oracle PUBLIC role.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Permissions granted to PUBLIC are granted to all users of the database.

If the value returned is less restrictive than 022, this is a finding.

The first number sets the mask for user/owner file permissions. The second number sets the mask for group file permissions. The third number sets file permission mask for other users. The list below shows the available settings:

0 = read/write/execute
1 = read/write
2 = read/execute
3 = read
4 = write/execute
5 = write
6 = execute
7 = no permissions

Setting the umask to 022 effectively sets files for user/owner to read/write, group to read and other to read. Directories are set for user/owner to read/write/execute, group to read/execute and other to read/execute.

For Windows Systems:
Review the permissions that control access to the Oracle installation software directories (e.g. \Program Files\Oracle\).

DBA accounts, the DBMS process account, the DBMS software installation/maintenance account, SA accounts if access by them is required for some operational level of support such as backups, and the host system itself require access.

If SERVICE_NAMES is set in the initialization file for the database instance, use (srv=[service name]), else, use (srv=*) if not set or rule applies to all databases on the DBMS server.

If network access restriction is performed by an external device, validate ACLs are in place to prohibit unauthorized access to the DBMS.

Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these internetworking mechanisms is private or secure and they do not by default restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established.

Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations after a security incident.

When organizations define security-related application functions or security-related application information, it is incumbent upon the application providing access to that data to ensure auditing of remote connectivity to those resources occurs in support of organizational requirements

Remote access to security functions (e.g., user management, audit log management, etc.) and security-relevant information requires the activity be audited by the organization. Any application providing remote access must support organizational requirements to audit access or organization-defined security functions and security-relevant information.

Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization  controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Some networking protocols allowing remote access may not meet security requirements to protect data and components. Bluetooth and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure networking protocols.

The DoD Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) program provides implementation guidance on the use of IP protocols and application and data services traversing the DoD Networks in a manner supporting net-centric operations.

Applications implementing or utilizing remote access network protocols need to ensure the application is developed and implemented in accordance with the PPSM requirements. In situations where it has been determined that specific operational requirements outweigh the risks of enabling an insecure network protocol, the organization may pursue a risk acceptance.

For example, if TCP was deemed as not secure, the listener.ora would need to be changed and the tcp entry would need to be removed.  That would only allow the listener to listen for an IPC connection.

Review DBMS settings to determine if the database is utilizing any network protocols deemed nonsecure.  If the DBMS is not using any network protocols deemed nonsecure, this is not a finding.

If the database is utilizing protocols specified as nonsecure in the PPSM, verify the protocols are explicitly identified in the System Security Plan and that they are in support of specific operational requirements. If they are not identified in the SSP or are not supporting specific operational requirements, this is a finding.

If nonsecure network protocols are not being used but are not disabled in the DBMS's configuration, this is a finding.

Roles and Profiles are two Oracle features that should be employed in account management. (Indeed, other requirements mandate the use of Roles.) Following are some notes from Oracle on the use of Profiles.

A profile is a named set of resource limits and password parameters that restrict database usage and instance resources for a user. You can assign a profile to each user, and a default profile to all others. Each user can have only one profile, and creating a new one supersedes any earlier one.

Profile resource limits are enforced only when you enable resource limitation for the associated database. Enabling such limitation can occur either before starting up the database (the RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter) or while it is open (using an ALTER SYSTEM statement).

Determine what the site-defined definition of an acceptably small level of manual account-management activity is.  If the site has established the definition, documented it, and obtained ISSO-ISSM-AO approval, use that definition.  If not, use the following rule of thumb as the definition:  no more than 12 such accounts exist or are expected to exist; no more than 100 manual account-management actions (account creation, modification, locking, unlocking, removal and the like) are expected to occur in the course of a year.

When these types of accounts are created, there is a risk that the temporary account may remain in place and active after the support representative has left.

To address this, in the event temporary application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period.  Such a process and capability greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or data compromised.

Note that user authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.

Resource Parameters:

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - Specify the total resource cost for a session, expressed in service units. Oracle Database calculates the total service units as a weighted sum of CPU_PER_SESSION, CONNECT_TIME,
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION, and PRIVATE_SGA.

SESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to limit the user to.

CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).

PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.

CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.

IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.

Password Parameters

Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes, specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log on to the user account before the account is locked. If omitting this clause, then the default is 10 times.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If setting a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If omitting this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, specify an integer for both of them.

If specifying a value for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

For example, if specifying PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

If specifying a value for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

If specifying DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile has not changed, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.

If setting both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if omitting both parameters.

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If omitting this clause, then the default is 1 day.

PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If omitting this clause, then the default is 7 days.

PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - The PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION clause lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but can create your own routine or use third-party software instead.</fixtext><fix id="F-67475r3_fix" /><check system="C-62431r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>If the organization has a policy, consistently enforced, forbidding the creation of emergency or temporary accounts, this is not a finding.

Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) must be employed by applications, when applicable, to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, domains) in the information system.

Consideration should be given to the implementation of an audited, explicit override of automated mechanisms in the event of emergencies or other serious events.

If appropriate access controls are not implemented to restrict access to authorized users and to restrict the access of those users to objects and data they are authorized to see, this is a finding.

The easiest way to isolate access is by using the Oracle Database Vault.  To check to see if the Oracle Database Vault is installed, issue the following query:

SQL&gt; SELECT * FROM V$OPTION WHERE PARAMETER = 'Oracle Database Vault';

If Oracle Database Vault is installed, review its settings for appropriateness and completeness of the access it permits and denies to each type of user.  If appropriate and complete, this is not a finding.

If Oracle Database Vault is not installed, review the roles and profiles in the database and the assignment of users to these for appropriateness and completeness of the access permitted and denied each type of user. If appropriate and complete, this is not a finding.

If the access permitted and denied each type of user is inappropriate or incomplete, this is a finding.

Following are code examples for reviewing roles, profiles, etc.

Find out what role the users have:
select * from dba_role_privs where granted_role = '&lt;role&gt;'

List all roles given to a user:
select * from dba_role_privs where grantee = '&lt;username&gt;';

List all roles for all users:
  column grantee format a32
  column granted_role format a32
  break on grantee
  select grantee, granted_role from dba_role_privs;

Use the following query to list all privileges given to a user:
        select
          lpad(' ', 2*level) || granted_role "User roles and privileges"
        from
          (

        connect by grantee = prior granted_role;

List which tables a certain role gives SELECT access to using the query:
select * from role_tab_privs where role='&lt;role&gt;' and privilege = 'SELECT';

List all tables a user can SELECT from using the query:
select * from dba_tab_privs where GRANTEE ='&lt;username&gt;' and privilege = 'SELECT';

List all users who can SELECT on a particular table (either through being given a relevant role or through a direct grant - e.g., grant select on a table to Joe). The result of this query should also show through which role the user has this access or whether it was a direct grant.

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data thereby providing increased information security for the organization.

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.  If the owner of an object or information does not have rights to exclude access to an object or information at a user level, users may gain access to objects and information they are not authorized to view/modify.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001362</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67493r1_fix">Modify DBMS settings to allow users to assign or revoke access rights to objects and information owned by the user.

The user profile, ORA_STIG_PROFILE, has been provided (starting with Oracle 12.1.0.2) to satisfy the STIG requirements pertaining to the profile parameters.

By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

More recent brute force attacks make attempts over long periods of time to circumvent intrusion detection systems and system account lockouts based entirely on the number of failed logons that are typically reset after a successful logon.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

The DBMS must ensure the recipient of permissions possesses only the access intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit rights propagation if that is the intent of the grantor.

(e.g., network interface, hard disk, modem, etc.). From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations define which application components shall provide auditable events.

The DBMS must provide auditing for the list of events defined by the organization or risk negatively impacting forensic investigations into malicious behavior in the information system. Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system, such as network interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be audited, as well.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components shall provide auditable events.

Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the DBMS configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.

The Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set of auditable events. Most can be audited via Oracle settings; some - marked here with an asterisk - cannot, and may require OS settings.
- Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g. classification levels).
- Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system level access
- Starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations.
- Successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects.

create audit policy policy1 actions grant;
create audit policy policy2 actions revoke;

To audit grants of object privileges on a specific object:
create audit policy policy3 actions grant on &lt;schema&gt;.&lt;object&gt;;

If Oracle Label Security is enabled, this will audit all OLS administrative actions:

To audit only logon attempts using administrative privileges (e.g. AS SYSDBA):
audit policy policy5 by SYS, SYSOPER, SYSBACKUP, SYSDG, SYSKM;

3) Starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations

This policy will audit all logon and logoff events. An individual session is identified in the UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL by the tuple (DBID, INSTANCE_ID, SESSIONID) and the start and end time will be indicated by the EVENT_TIMESTAMP of the logon and logoff events:

9) All database parameter changes

To audit any database parameter changes, dynamic or static:
create audit policy policy12 actions alter database, alter system, create spfile;

Applying the Policy

The following command will enable the policy in all database sessions and audit both successful and unsuccessful actions:
audit policy policy1;

To audit only unsuccessful actions, add the WHENEVER NOT SUCCESSFUL modifier:

Notes on Oracle audit capabilities follow.

Unified Audit supports named audit policies, which are defined using the CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement. A policy specifies the actions that should be audited and the objects to which it should apply. If no specific objects are included in the policy definition, it applies to all objects.

A named policy is enabled using the AUDIT POLICY statement. It can be enabled for all users, for specific users only, or for all except a specified list of users. The policy can audit successful actions, unsuccessful actions, or both.

Verifying existing audit policy:  existing Unified Audit policies are listed in the view AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES. The AUDIT_OPTION column contains one of the actions specified in a CREATE AUDIT POLICY statement. The AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE column contains 'STANDARD ACTION' for a policy that applies to all objects or 'OBJECT ACTION' for a policy that audits actions on a specific object.

select POLICY_NAME from SYS.AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES where AUDIT_OPTION='GRANT' and AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE='STANDARD ACTION';

To find policies that audit privilege grants on specific objects:

select POLICY_NAME,OBJECT_SCHEMA,OBJECT_NAME from SYS.AUDIT_UNIFIED_POLICIES where AUDIT_OPTION='GRANT' and AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE='OBJECT ACTION';

The view AUDIT_UNIFIED_ENABLED_POLICIES shows which Unified Audit policies are enabled. The ENABLED_OPT and USER_NAME columns show the users for whom the policy is enabled or 'ALL USERS'. The SUCCESS and FAILURE columns indicate if the policy is enabled for successful or unsuccessful actions, respectively.

For ease of management, it is recommended that the audit tables be kept in a dedicated tablespace.

If Oracle Enterprise Manager is in use, the capability to issue such an alert is built in and configurable via the console so an email can be sent to a designated administrator.

If Enterprise Manager is unavailable, the following script can be used to monitor storage space; this can be combined with additional code to email the appropriate administrator so they can take action.

This is generally accomplished by removing records generated by specified classes of events, such as records generated by nightly backups.

An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy requirements regarding what must be audited on the system and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. It is important to recognize audit reduction does not alter original audit records.  

Audit reduction and reporting tools do not alter original audit records.

To leverage the complete capability of audit reduction, the application must possess the ability to specify and automatically process certain event criteria that are selectable in nature. In other words, a system administrator (SA) may be performing a manual review of audit data to identify a particular problem. The SA has determined that backup activity and network connections from a particular host comprise the bulk of the events. However, these events are not related to the activity being investigated. The application must be able to automatically process these audit records for audit reduction purposes rather than making the administrator manually process them.

The lack of audit reduction and reporting in a database can require the DBA, or others responsible for reviewing audit logs, to sort through large amounts of data in order to find relevant records.  This can cause important audit records to be missed.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000158</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67563r1_fix">Utilize a DBMS tool or separate application that provides the ability to automatically process audit records for events based on selectable event criteria.</fixtext><fix id="F-67563r1_fix" /><check system="C-62521r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review DBMS to determine whether it provides the ability to automatically process audit records for events based on selectable event criteria.

If Standard Auditing is used:
Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who should not have access to it.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and wanting to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that would be used for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; 

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list] 

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) 

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. Can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

Can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: Cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.
routine-designator

  {
   qualified-name [ signature ]
  }

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if there are other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see "SQL standard authorization" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges:

All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges:

Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

To ensure the veracity of audit data the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion. This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design.

Some commonly employed methods include:  ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections; restricting access; and backing up log data to ensure log data is retained.  

Applications providing a user interface to audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the data and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the deletion of audit data.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

Deletion of database audit data could mask the theft of, or the unauthorized modification of, sensitive data stored in the database.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000164</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67571r2_fix">Add controls and modify permissions to protect database audit log data from unauthorized deletion, whether stored in the database itself or at the OS-level.

If Standard Auditing is used:
Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who should not have access to it.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and wanting to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that would be used for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; 

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list] 

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) 

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. Can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

Can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: Cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.

  {
   qualified-name [ signature ]
  }

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if there are  other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see "SQL standard authorization" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges:

All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges:

Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

If auditing is not enabled, use the following steps to enable auditing.

sqlplus connect as sysdba

Turn on Oracle audit

a. If the database uses an spfile

SQL&gt; alter system set audit_trail=DB,EXTENDED scope=spfile ;
System altered.

b. if database uses pfile, modify init&lt;Sid&gt;.ora directly.
For these changes to take place, the database must be restarted.

Next we create an encrypted tablespace. Before tablespaces can be encrypted or decrypted, a master encryption key must be generated or set. The tablespace master encryption key is stored in an external security module and is used to encrypt the TDE tablespace encryption keys.

Check to ensure that the ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION (or WALLET_LOCATION) parameter in the sqlnet.ora file points to the correct software wallet location. For example:

ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION=
  (SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=
   (DIRECTORY=/app/wallet)))

If the ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION parameter is not set, then it attempts to use the keystore in the location that is specified by the parameter WALLET_LOCATION.

If the WALLET_LOCATION parameter is also not set, then Oracle Database looks for a keystore at the default database location, which is ORACLE_BASE/admin/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/wallet or ORACLE_HOME/admin/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/wallet. (DB_UNIQUE_NAME is the unique name of the database specified in the initialization parameter file.) When the keystore location is not set in the sqlnet.ora file, then the V$ENCRYPTION_WALLET view displays the default location. Can check the location and status of the keystore in the V$ENCRYPTION_WALLET view.

Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1) uses the same master encryption key for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. When issuing the ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY command, a unified master encryption key is created for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. 

Resetting the Tablespace Master Encryption Key

Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1) uses a unified master encryption key for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. When resetting (rekeying) the master encryption key for TDE column encryption, the master encryption key for TDE tablespace encryption also gets reset. The ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY command resets the tablespace master encryption key. Before creating an encrypted tablespace, the Oracle wallet containing the tablespace master encryption key must be open. The wallet must also be open before accessing data in an encrypted tablespace. The security administrator needs to open the Oracle wallet after starting the Oracle instance. A restart of the Oracle instance requires the security administrator to open the wallet again.  The security administrator also needs to open the wallet before performing database recovery operations. This is because background processes may require access to encrypted redo and undo logs. When performing database recovery, the wallet must be opened before opening the database. This is illustrated in the following statements:

SQL&gt; STARTUP MOUNT;
SQL&gt; ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION WALLET OPEN IDENTIFIED BY "password";
SQL&gt; ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

Can also choose to use auto logon wallets if the environment does not require the extra security provided by a wallet that needs to be explicitly opened; however, this is not the recommended practice.

Creating the wallet/keystore

SQL&gt; ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT CREATE KEYSTORE '/app/wallet' IDENTIFIED BY password;

keystore altered.

Set the TDE Master Encryption Key in the Software Keystore

SQL&gt; ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEY IDENTIFIED BY password  WITH BACKUP USING 'backup_identifier';

keystore altered.

Creating an Encrypted Tablespace

The CREATE TABLESPACE command enables the creation of an encrypted tablespace. The permanent_tablespace_clause enables choosing the encryption algorithm and the key length for encryption. The ENCRYPT keyword in the storage_clause encrypts the tablespace. The following syntax illustrates this:

CREATE
   [ BIGFILE | SMALLFILE ]
   { permanent_tablespace_clause
   | temporary_tablespace_clause
   | undo_tablespace_clause
   } ;

Where, permanent_tablespace_clause=TABLESPACE , ENCRYPTION [USING algorithm] storage_clause
Where, storage_clause=[ENCRYPT] where:

The encryption algorithm can have one of the following values:

3DES168
AES128
AES192
AES256

The key lengths are included in the names of the algorithms themselves. If no encryption algorithm is specified, the default encryption algorithm is used. The default encryption algorithm is AES128.

Note: The ENCRYPTION keyword in the permanent_tablespace_clause is used to specify the encryption algorithm. The ENCRYPT keyword in the storage_clause actually encrypts the tablespace. For security reasons, a tablespace cannot be encrypted with the NO SALT option.

Commands to create Encrypted Tablespace

 CREATE TABLESPACE securespace
 DATAFILE '/home/user/oradata/secure01.dbf'
 SIZE 150M
 ENCRYPTION USING '3DES168'
 DEFAULT STORAGE(ENCRYPT);

This creates a tablespace called securespace2 using an algorithm of 3DES168.

Cannot encrypt an existing tablespace. However, can import data into an encrypted tablespace using the Oracle Data Pump utility. Can also use SQL commands like CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT...or ALTER TABLE...MOVE... to move data into an encrypted tablespace. The CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT... command enables the creation of a table from an existing table. The ALTER TABLE...MOVE... command enables the move of a table into the encrypted tablespace.

Then we move the sys.aud$ from system tablespace to securespace tablespace. 

SQL&gt; exec DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(audit_trail_type =&gt; DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD, audit_trail_location_value =&gt; 'securespace');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

Then check the tablespace the table is stored in. 

SQL&gt; SELECT table_name, tablespace_name FROM dba_tables WHERE table_name ='AUD$';

TABLE_NAME                     TABLESPACE_NAME

If not, this is a finding

If standard, table-based auditing is used:  The audit logs are written to a table called AUD$, and if a Virtual Private Database is deployed, we also create a table called FGA_LOG$.  First check the current location of the audit trail tables.

If the tablespace name is SYSTEM, the table needs to be relocated to its own tablespace. Ensure that adequate space is allocated to that tablespace.

If Unified Auditing is used:
Audit logs are written to tables in the AUDSYS schema. The default tablespace for AUDSYS is USERS. A separate tablespace should be created to contain audit data.

Notes on Oracle Backup and Recovery Solutions

When implementing a backup and recovery strategy, have the following solutions available:

--  Recovery Manager (RMAN)
Recovery Manager is fully integrated with the Oracle database to perform a range of backup and recovery activities, including maintaining an RMAN repository of historical data about backups. Can access RMAN through the command line or through Oracle Enterprise Manager.

--  User-managed backup and recovery
In this solution, perform backup and recovery with a mixture of host operating system commands and SQL*Plus recovery commands. Responsible for determining all aspects of when and how backups and recovery are done.

--  Media management
If not wanting to use RMAN with an encrypted backup, consider configuring RMAN to make backups to a media manager.  On most platforms, to back up to and restore from sequential media such as tape, must integrate a media manager with the Oracle database. Can use Oracle Secure Backup, which supports both database and file system backups to tape, as the media manager. See Oracle Secure Backup Administrator's Guide to learn how to set up RMAN for use specifically with Oracle Secure Backup.

These solutions are supported by Oracle and are fully documented, but RMAN is the preferred solution for database backup and recovery. RMAN provides a common interface for backup tasks across different host operating systems and offers several backup techniques not available through user-managed methods.

--  Incremental backups:
An incremental backup stores only blocks changed since a previous backup.  Thus, they provide more compact backups and faster recovery, thereby reducing the need to apply redo during data file media recovery. If enabling block change tracking, then can improve performance by avoiding full scans of every input data file. Can use the BACKUP INCREMENTAL command to perform incremental backups.

--  Block media recovery:
Can repair a data file with only a small number of corrupt data blocks without taking it off-line or restoring it from backup. Can use the RECOVER BLOCK command to perform block media recovery.

--  Binary compression:
A binary compression mechanism integrated into Oracle Database reduces the size of backups.

--  Encrypted backups:
RMAN uses backup encryption capabilities integrated into Oracle Database to store backup sets in an encrypted format. To create encrypted backups on disk, the database must use the Advanced Security Option. To create encrypted backups directly on tape, RMAN must use the Oracle Secure Backup SBT interface but does not require the Advanced Security Option.

--  Automated database duplication:
Easily creates a copy of the database, supporting various storage configurations, including direct duplication between ASM databases.

--  Cross-platform data conversion:
Whether using RMAN or user-managed methods, can supplement physical backups with logical backups of schema objects made with Data Pump Export utility. Can later use Data Pump Import to re-create data after restore and recovery.  Logical backups are mostly beyond the scope of the backup and recovery documentation.</fixtext><fix id="F-67603r1_fix" /><check system="C-62565r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review DBMS recovery procedures and technical system features to determine if mechanisms exist and are in place to specify use of trusted files during DBMS recovery.

Database management systems and transaction-based processing systems are examples of information systems that are transaction-based. Transaction rollback and transaction journaling are examples of mechanisms supporting transaction recovery.

The maintenance of data integrity involves preservation and control of not only the data contents, but the relationships between two or more related data items and the actions taken on one that may affect others. A DBMS provides data integrity that may be affected by incomplete or interrupted transactions by means of logging transaction events. This allows the database to recover data content to a point where the data content and its relationships are known to be intact. This data integrity is maintained when the data is undergoing a change or update event. Most DBMS's enable transaction rollback or recovery by default and as an automatic feature of database recovery.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000553</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67605r1_fix">Enable transaction journaling for the database.

The Oracle recommended process for backup and recovery is Oracle RMAN. If Oracle RMAN is deployed, execute the following commands to ensure that the evidence of the implementation of the backup policy includes validating that the files are restorable:

Validating Database Files with BACKUP VALIDATE
--Use the BACKUP VALIDATE command to do the following:
--Check datafiles for physical and logical block corruption
--Confirm that all database files exist and are in the correct locations
--When BACKUP VALIDATE is run, RMAN reads the files to be backed up in their entirety, as it would during a real backup. RMAN does not, however, actually produce any backup sets or image copies.
--Cannot use the BACKUPSET, MAXCORRUPT, or PROXY parameters with BACKUP VALIDATE.
--To validate files with the BACKUP VALIDATE command:
  1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database and recovery catalog (if used).
  2. Run the BACKUP VALIDATE command.

For example, can validate that all database files and archived logs can be backed up by running a command as shown in the following example. This command checks for physical corruptions only.

BACKUP VALIDATE
DATABASE
ARCHIVELOG ALL;

To check for logical corruptions in addition to physical corruptions, run the  following variation of the preceding command:

BACKUP VALIDATE
CHECK LOGICAL
DATABASE
ARCHIVELOG ALL;

In the preceding examples, the RMAN client displays the same output that it would if it were really backing up the files. If RMAN cannot back up one or more of the files, then it issues an error message.

Validating Backups Before Restoring Them

Run RESTORE ... VALIDATE to test whether RMAN can restore a specific file or set of files from a backup. RMAN chooses which backups to use. The database must be mounted or open for this command. Do not have to take datafiles off-line when validating the restore of datafiles, because validation of backups of the datafiles only reads the backups and does not affect the production datafiles. When validating files on disk or tape, RMAN reads all blocks in the backup piece or image copy. RMAN also validates off-site backups. The validation is identical to a real restore operation except that RMAN does not write output files.

To validate backups with the RESTORE command:
1. Run the RESTORE command with the VALIDATE option.

This following example illustrates validating the restore of the database and all archived redo logs:

RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE;
RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL VALIDATE;

If an RMAN error stack is not generated, then skip the subsequent steps. The lack of error messages means that RMAN had confirmed that it can use these backups successfully during a real restore and recovery.

2. If error messages are seen in the output and one is the RMAN-06026 message, then investigate the cause of the problem. If possible, correct the problem that is preventing RMAN from validating the backups and retry the validation. The following error means that RMAN cannot restore one or more of the specified files from available backups:

RMAN-06026: some targets not found - aborting restore
The following sample output shows that RMAN encountered a problem reading the specified backup:

RMAN-03009: failure of restore command on c1 channel at 12-DEC-14 23:22:30
ORA-19505: failed to identify file "oracle/dbs/1fafv9gl_1_1"

Factors include:
(i) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);
(ii) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
(iii) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

A non-privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a regular or non-privileged user.

Local Access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.

The lack of multifactor authentication makes it much easier for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

Use authentication to prove the identities of users who are attempting to log on to the database. Authenticating user identity is imperative in distributed environments, without which there can be little confidence in network security. Passwords are the most common means of authentication. Oracle Database enables strong authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including TLS with digital certificates.

A shared authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a shared authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a shared authenticator is the UNIX OS 'root' user account, a Windows 'administrator' account, an 'SA' account, or a 'helpdesk' account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a shared authenticator.

Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a shared authenticator, this requirement will apply.

There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000770</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67627r1_fix">Configure DBMS, OS and/or enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism to require individual authentication prior to authentication for shared account access.

(Oracle Access Manager may be helpful in meeting this requirement. Notes on Oracle Access Manager follow.)

Oracle Access Manager is used when there is a need for multifactor authentication of applications front-ending Oracle Datasets that may use group accounts. Oracle Access Manager supports using PKI-based smart cards (CAC, PIV) for multifactor authentication. When a user authenticates to a smart card application, the smart card engine produces a certificate-based authentication token. Can configure a certificate-based authentication scheme in Oracle Access Manager that uses information from the smart card certificate. Certificate-based authentication works with any smart card or similar device that presents an X.509 certificate.

Check:
First, check that the Authentication Module is set up properly:
1) Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.  Select the X509Scheme.
2) Make sure the Authentication Module option is set to X509Plugin.

Second, check that the Authentication policy is using the x509Scheme:
1) Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.
2) Select Application Domains.  Select Search.
3) Select the application domain protecting the Oracle Database.
4) Select the Authentication Polices tab and Click Protected Resource Policy.
5) Make sure the Authentication Scheme is set to x509Scheme.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-61713"><title>SRG-APP-000156-DB-000111</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-76203r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O121-C2-013600</version><title>The DBMS must use organization-defined replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged accounts.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.

Replay attacks, if successfully used against a database account, could result in unfettered access to the database settings and data. A successful replay attack against a privileged database account could result in a complete compromise of the database.

Oracle Database enables you to encrypt data that is sent over a network.  There is no distinction between privileged and non-privileged accounts.

Encryption of network data provides data privacy so that unauthorized parties are not able to view plaintext data as it passes over the network. Oracle Database also provides protection against two forms of active attacks.

Data modification attack:  An unauthorized party intercepting data in transit, altering it, and retransmitting it is a data modification attack. For example, intercepting a $100 bank deposit, changing the amount to $10,000, and retransmitting the higher amount is a data modification attack.

Replay attack:  Repetitively retransmitting an entire set of valid data is a replay attack, such as intercepting a $100 bank withdrawal and retransmitting it ten times, thereby receiving $1,000.

Changing passwords frequently can thwart password-guessing attempts or re-establish protection of a compromised DBMS account.

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information that can be used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

For example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

For example: mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -create
Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
Enter password: password

For example: mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
Enter password: password

In this specification, the wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.  The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into client sqlnet.ora file:

    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
           )
          )

4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )
        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1

Note: "SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1" is the actual value, not a suggestion to use one or the other.</fixtext><fix id="F-67649r2_fix" /><check system="C-62611r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>(Oracle stores and displays its passwords in encrypted form.  Nevertheless, this should be verified by reviewing the relevant system views, along with the other items to be checked here.)

Ask the DBA to review the list of DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within and external to the DBMS that access the database. The list should also include files, tables, or settings used to configure the operational environment for the DBMS and for interactive DBMS user accounts.

Ask the DBA and/or ISSO to determine if any DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within or external to the DBMS that access the database, and DBMS/user environment files/settings/tables, contain database passwords. If any do, confirm that DBMS passwords stored internally or externally to the DBMS are encoded or encrypted.

If any passwords are stored in clear text, this is a finding.

Ask the DBA/SA/Application Support staff if they have created an external password store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.  Verify that all passwords stored there are encrypted.

If a password store is used and any password is not encrypted, this is a finding.

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.

You can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.

This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.

The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.

How Does the External Password Store Work?

Typically, users (and applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.

For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.

The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:

  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@orasales
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17
  Enter password: password

In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. Could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.

However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER

In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; cannot create one connection string for multiple users.

In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-61735"><title>SRG-APP-000174-DB-000077</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-76225r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O121-C2-014900</version><title>Procedures for establishing temporary passwords that meet DoD password requirements for new accounts must be defined, documented, and implemented.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password maximum lifetime is  the maximum period of time, (typically in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change it.

Passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals as per policy. Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked.

One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the system and/or application passwords could be compromised.

New accounts authenticated by passwords that are created without a password or with an easily guessed password are vulnerable to unauthorized access.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

  For example:

  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

 1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:

 mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -create
    Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. 

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

    mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
    Enter password: password

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
    Enter password: password

    In this specification:

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.

The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.

The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if the wallet was created in
       $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:

    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
           )
          )

 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )

        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1

The check would depend on the information provided by the DBA.  In a default Oracle installation, all passwords are stored in an encrypted manner.  Ask the DBA if they have created an External Password Store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.

Secure External Password Store

Can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.

This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.

The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.

How Does the External Password Store Work?

Typically, users (and as applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.

For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.

The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:

  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@orasales
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17
  Enter password: password

In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. Could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.

However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials:

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER
  
In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; cannot create one connection string for multiple users.

In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologon feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-61739"><title>SRG-APP-000174-DB-000080</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-76229r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O121-C2-015200</version><title>The DBMS must enforce password maximum lifetime restrictions.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password maximum lifetime is  the maximum period of time, (typically in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change it.

(OMB Circular A-130) Any telecommunications or information system operated by the United States Government, the function, operation, or use of which (1) involves intelligence activities; (2) involves cryptologic activities related to national security; (3) involves command and control of military forces; (4) involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or (5) is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions, but excluding any system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).

There is more information on this topic in the Oracle Database 12c Advanced Security Administrator's Guide, which may be found at https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ASOAG/toc.htm.  (Note, however, that because of changes in Oracle's licensing policy, it is no longer necessary to purchase Oracle Advanced Security to use network encryption and advanced authentication.)

To see if there are encrypted tablespaces, enter the following SQL*Plus command:

SELECT * FROM V$ENCRYPTED_TABLESPACES;

If no rows are returned, then there are no encrypted tablespaces.

To see if there are encrypted columns within existing tables, enter the following SQL*Plus command:

If the appropriate controls include placing the data in a read-only tablespace, proceed as follows.

After we figure out the tablespace the data object is stored in:
$ sqlplus connect as sysdba
SQL&gt; SELECT table_name, tablespace_name from dba_tables where upper(table_name) like &amp;tablename_from_developer;

Once we get the name of the tablespace where all of the important data is stored, alter the tablespace to be read-only.

The following statement makes the flights tablespace read-only:
 ALTER TABLESPACE flights READ ONLY;

No transactions are allowed to make further changes (using DML statements) to the tablespace. If a transaction attempts further changes, it is terminated and rolled back. However, transactions that already made changes and that attempt no further changes are allowed to commit or roll back.

The ALTER TABLESPACE...READ ONLY statement waits for the following transactions to either commit or roll back before returning: transactions that have pending or uncommitted changes to the tablespace and that were started before the statement was issued. If a transaction started before the statement remains active, but rolls back to a savepoint, rolling back its changes to the tablespace, then the statement no longer waits for this active transaction.</fixtext><fix id="F-67679r1_fix" /><check system="C-62641r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Determine whether the database houses and distributes information to the public.

All of the permissions and policies we would employ to protect information would be in play, like access control mechanisms, auditing, and password protection.  For data that is for display or download to the public for their informational needs, it may be appropriate to place the data in a read-only tablespace.  This will provide the DBA with the ability to modify content as needed by modifying the tablespace from read-only to read-write in the event the content needs to be modified.  Check with the Application Developer to see what tables are used to store the data and/or content that is displayed to the public.  Then find the tablespace name the data objects are stored in.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba

SQL&gt; SELECT table_name, tablespace_name from dba_tables where upper(table_name) like &amp;tablename_from_developer;

For better performance while accessing data in a read-only tablespace, can issue a query that accesses all of the blocks of the tables in the tablespace just before making it read-only. A simple query, such as SELECT COUNT (*), executed against each table ensures that the data blocks in the tablespace can be subsequently accessed most efficiently. This eliminates the need for the database to check the status of the transactions that most recently modified the blocks.

The following statement makes the flights tablespace read-only:

ALTER TABLESPACE flights READ ONLY;
 
Can issue the ALTER TABLESPACE...READ ONLY statement while the database is processing transactions. After the statement is issued, the tablespace is put into a transitional read-only state. No transactions are allowed to make further changes (using DML statements) to the tablespace.

If a transaction attempts further changes, it is terminated and rolled back. However, transactions that already made changes and that attempt no further changes are allowed to commit or roll back.

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session.   Applications will make application decisions and execute business logic based on the session ID. Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attackers are unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the application must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.

Database sessions must be terminated when no longer in use in order to prevent session hijacking.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001185</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67681r2_fix">Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon user logoff.  Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon the occurrence of any organization or policy-defined session termination event.

- - - - -
To configure specific session termination processes, we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event.  Below are some examples.

Oracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter.

Can use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with "alter profile" statements:

alter profile senior_claim_analyst limit
   connect_time 15
   sessions_per_user 2
   ldle_time 10;

Profiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when users are created, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources.

The syntax to create a profile follows:

CREATE PROFILE  LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;
Resource_parameters: 
 [SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [CPU_PER_SESSION   n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]    
 [CPU_PER_CALL      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]           
 [CONNECT_TIME      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [IDLE_TIME         n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]

By setting resource limits, can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. Can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.

The system resource limits can be enforced at the session level, the call level, or both. The session level is calculated from the time the user logs on to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.

Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME

The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If there is a need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.

When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:

sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.

The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.

Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.

Turning-on expire_time

To set up these advanced features, simply edit the sqlnet.ora file.  If a beginner, follow this procedure:

Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.

In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local &gt;&gt; Profile.

From the list on the right-hand pane, select General.

Click on the Advanced tab.

Next, enter the values for the fields or options to set.

When finished, choose File &gt;&gt; Save Network Configuration to write the changes to the sqlnet.ora file.

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.

Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.

To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.) Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error.</fixtext><fix id="F-67681r2_fix" /><check system="C-62643r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review DBMS settings and vendor documentation to verify user sessions are terminated upon user logout. If they are not, this is a finding.

Review system documentation and organization policy to identify other events that should result in session terminations. If other session termination events are defined, review DBMS settings to verify occurrences of these events would cause session termination.

If occurrences of defined session-terminating events do not cause session terminations, this is a finding.

When a user logs off of an Oracle session gracefully or has the session terminated for an idle timeout or any other reason, the session is terminated, and the resources are returned to the system.  Check with the DBA to see what mechanism is used to disconnect the session and what events the site uses to determine if a connection needs to be terminated.

To test for timeout, open a connection and leave it idle for a period greater than the defined idle timeout setting enforced by the system.  Then try to use the connection.  If the connection is no longer active, then the mechanism deployed to terminate the connection is active and working.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-61767"><title>SRG-APP-000225-DB-000153</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-76257r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O121-C2-018100</version><title>The DBMS must fail to a known safe state for defined types of failures.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure in a known state can address safety or security in accordance with the mission/business needs of the organization.

Failure in a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system.

Failure in a known safe state helps prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause loss of data or unauthorized access to system resources. Applications or systems that fail suddenly and with no incorporated failure state planning may leave the hosting system available but with a reduced security protection capability. Preserving information system state information also facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes.

An example is a firewall that blocks all traffic rather than allowing all traffic when a firewall component fails. This prevents an attacker from forcing a failure of the system in order to obtain access.

Oracle recommends using Transparent Data Encryption to protect data.

In order to check to see if the data is encrypted, for example, upon an auditor's request, Oracle provides views that document the encryption status of the database. For TDE column encryption, use the view 'dba_encrypted_columns', which lists the owner, table name, column name, encryption algorithm, and salt for all encrypted columns. For TDE tablespace encryption, the following SQL statement lists all encrypted tablespaces with their encryption algorithm and corresponding, encrypted, data files.  Issue the following commands to check to see if the data at rest is encrypted.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba

Oracle recommends using Transparent Data Encryption to protect data at rest.

In order to check to see if the data is encrypted, for example, upon an auditor's request, Oracle provides views that document the encryption status of the database. For TDE column encryption, use the view 'dba_encrypted_columns', which lists the owner, table name, column name, encryption algorithm, and salt for all encrypted columns. For TDE tablespace encryption, the following SQL statement lists all encrypted tablespaces with their encryption algorithm and corresponding, encrypted, data files.  Issue the following commands to check to see if the data at rest is encrypted.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba

SQL&gt; SELECT t.name "TSName", 
       e.encryptionalg "Algorithm",
       d.file_name "File Name"

       dba_data_files d
     WHERE  t.ts# = e.ts#
     and t.name = d.tablespace_name;

The next SQL statement lists the table owner, tables within encrypted tablespaces, and the encryption algorithm:

Oracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints.

Integrity Constraint States
Can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE). If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered or updated in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.

Additionally, can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if specified NOVALIDATE, are not ensured that existing data conforms.

An integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states:
    ENABLE, VALIDATE
    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE
    DISABLE, VALIDATE
    DISABLE, NOVALIDATE

For details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, see the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.

Disabling Constraints
To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:

- When loading large amounts of data into a table

- When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number)

- When importing or exporting one table at a time

In all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.

It is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.

Enabling Constraints
While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.

Can identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. See "Reporting Constraint Exceptions". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which can be examined.

ENABLE, NOVALIDATE Constraint State
When a constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with ENABLE, NOVALIDATE constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Constraints in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.

Enabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint novalidate is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating reduces the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.

Efficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure

Using integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:
    Disable state.
    Perform the operation (load, export, import).
    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state.
    Enable state.

Some benefits of using constraints in this order are:
    No locks are held.
    All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.
    Constraint enabling is done in parallel.
    Concurrent activity on table is permitted.

Setting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition
When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by the specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.

Disabling Constraints Upon Definition
The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
   empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
   ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.

Enabling Constraints Upon Definition

The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
    ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. If this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.

When enabling a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, an associated index is created.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-61787"><title>SRG-APP-000262-DB-000159</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-76277r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O121-C2-019600</version><title>The system must verify there have not been unauthorized changes to the DBMS software and information.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations are required to employ integrity verification applications on information systems to look for evidence of information tampering, errors, and omissions.

This can be accomplished by using Oracle Audit Vault and/or Oracle Enterprise Manager. If neither of these products is deployed, then develop a site-specific solution.

- - - - -
Notes to assist in developing a site-specific solution:

The AUD$ table has a column called RETURNCODE.  That column provides the return code; so, for example, if the security-related condition is someone trying to select data from a table that is not there, it would show up in the AUD$ table as an ORA-00942 - table or view does not exist.  Since the RETURNCODE column is only numeric, only the 00942 would be stored. If the query for the information returned a row, the process would then need to form and send an email message.

Oracle recommends the use of Oracle Audit Vault to fill this requirement without creating a custom solution.   It is possible to set up notifications and alerts in Enterprise Manager as well, and if either of these alternatives is not available, a custom solution will be necessary.</fixtext><fix id="F-67705r1_fix" /><check system="C-62667r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Check DBMS settings to determine whether security-related error conditions are monitored for, and whether appropriate personnel are notified.

Notes on Oracle's approach to this issue:  Out of the box, Oracle covers this. For example, if a user does not have access to a table, the error is just that the table or view does not exist. The Oracle database is not going to display a Social Security Number in an error code unless an application is programmed to do so.  Oracle applications will not expose the actual transactional data to a screen.  The only way Oracle will capture this information is to enable specific logging levels.

To check to see what roles are assigned to a user, run the query:
SELECT * from user_role_privs;

To check to see what privileges are assigned to a role, run the query:
SELECT * from role_sys_privs;


To show privileges by object, run the query:

SELECT table_name, grantee,
MAX(DECODE(privilege, 'SELECT', 'SELECT')) AS select_priv,
MAX(DECODE(privilege, 'DELETE', 'DELETE')) AS delete_priv,
MAX(DECODE(privilege, 'UPDATE', 'UPDATE')) AS update_priv,
MAX(DECODE(privilege, 'INSERT', 'INSERT')) AS insert_priv
FROM dba_tab_privs
WHERE grantee IN (SELECT role FROM dba_roles)
GROUP BY table_name, grantee
ORDER BY table_name, grantee;


This query will list the system privileges assigned to a specific user:

SELECT LPAD(' ', 2*level) || granted_role "USER PRIVS"
FROM (
SELECT NULL grantee, username granted_role
FROM dba_users
WHERE username LIKE UPPER('%&amp;uname%')
UNION
SELECT grantee, granted_role

The DBMS must display an authorized banner upon logon of interactive accounts unless the banner text was already displayed to the user via the operating system logon on the server on which the application resides.  The banner is not required for non-interactive accounts.

(i) users are accessing a U.S. Government information system; 
(ii) system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;

System use notification messages can be implemented in the form of warning banners displayed when individuals log on to the information system.

System use notification is intended only for information system access including an interactive logon interface with a human user and is not intended to require notification when an interactive interface does not exist.

Use this banner for desktops, laptops, and other devices accommodating banners of 1300 characters.

While it is true that those accountable for systems want to ensure they are not affected by a DoS attack, they also need to ensure their systems and applications are not used to launch such an attack against others. To that extent, a variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks.

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices from being directly affected by  DoS attacks. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks.

Applications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use these applications to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. An example would be designing applications to include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application.

The methods employed to counter this risk will be dependent upon the potential application layer methods that can be used to exploit it.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001094</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67731r7_fix">Configure DBMS settings to restrict functionality that could be used to initiate DoS attacks.


Securing the Network Connection:
Protecting the network and its traffic from inappropriate access or modification is the essence of network security. You should consider all paths the data travels, and assess the threats on each path and node. Then, take steps to lessen or eliminate those threats and the consequences of a security breach. In addition, monitor and audit to detect either increased threat levels or penetration attempts.

The following practices improve network security:


1. Disable the Default Listener.
All listeners have a unique name instead of the name LISTENER and have startup protection.

LISTENER=(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST=)(PORT = 0)))

This configuration prevents the default listener from starting.


2. Prevent online administration by requiring the administrator to have the write privilege on the listener.ora file on the server.
a. Add or alter this line in the listener.ora file:

ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_LISTENER=ON

b. Use RELOAD to reload the configuration.


3. Set Protection against crafted network packets on database level.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION specifies the action that the database should take when bad packets are received from a possibly malicious client.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION = { NONE | TRACE | LOG | ALERT } (TRACE is the default)

NONE: The database server ignores the bad packets and does not generate any trace files or log messages. (Not recommended)

TRACE: A detailed trace file is generated when bad packets are received, which can be used to debug any problems in client/server communication.

LOG: A minimal log message is printed in the alert logfile and in the server trace file. A minimal amount of disk space is used.

ALERT: An alert message is sent to a DBA or monitoring console.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION specifies the further execution of a server process when receiving bad packets from a possibly malicious client.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION = { CONTINUE | (DELAY,integer) | (DROP,integer) } (DROP,3 is the default)

CONTINUE: The server process continues execution. The database server may be subject to a Denial of Service (DoS) if bad packets continue to be sent by a malicious client. (Not recommended)

(DELAY, integer) :The client experiences a delay of integer seconds before the server process accepts the next request from the same client connection. Malicious clients are prevented from excessive consumption of server resources while legitimate clients experience degradation in performance but can continue to function.

(DROP, integer) : The server forcefully terminates the client connection after integer bad packets. The server protects itself at the expense of the client (for example, a client transaction may be lost). The client may reconnect and attempt the same operation.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS specifies the number of authentication attempts that can be made by a client on a connection to the server process. After the specified number of failure attempts, the connection will be automatically dropped by the server process.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = n (3 is the default) Values range from 1 to unlimited. (A value of 1 to 3 is recommended)

For more information about the parameters in listener.ora, see https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETRF/listener.htm#NETRF008


4. When a host computer has multiple IP addresses associated with multiple network interface controller (NIC) cards, configure the listener to the specific IP address.

You can restrict the listener to listen on a specific IP address. Oracle recommends that you specify the specific IP addresses on these types of computers, rather than allowing the listener to listen on all IP addresses. Restricting the listener to specific IP addresses helps to prevent an intruder from stealing a TCP end point from under the listener process.


5. Restrict the privileges of the listener, so that it cannot read or write files in the database or the Oracle server address space.

The default configuration for external procedures does not require a network listener to work with Oracle Database and the extproc agent. The extproc agent is spawned directly by Oracle Database and eliminates the risks that the extproc agent might be spawned by Oracle Listener unexpectedly. This default configuration is recommended for maximum security. For more information about securing external procedures see
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/app_devs.htm#DBSEG656
However, the extproc agent can be configured to be spawned by a listener. In that case (not recommended) the listener should have restricted privileges.


6. Use a firewall, IAW DoD network policy and guidance.

Appropriately placed and configured firewalls can prevent outside access to your databases.


7. Prevent unauthorized administration of the Oracle listener.

Local administration of the listener is secure by default through the local operating system. Therefore configuring a password is neither required nor recommended for secure local administration. However, a password can be configured for the listener to provide security for administrative operations, such as starting or stopping the listener, viewing a list of supported services, or saving changes to the Listener Control configuration.

By default, Oracle Net Listener permits only local administration for security reasons. As a policy, the listener can be administered only by the user who started it. This is enforced through local operating system authentication. For example, if user1 starts the listener, then only user1 can administer it. Any other user trying to administer the listener gets an error. The super user is the only exception.

Oracle recommends that you perform listener administration in the default mode (secure by means of local operating system authentication), and access the system remotely using a remote logon. Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control can also be used for remote administration.


8. Encrypt network traffic.  (Mandatory for sensitive data and optional for non-sensitive, as covered in other STIG requirements.)

Where applicable, use Oracle network data encryption to encrypt network traffic among clients, databases, and application servers.


9. Set Connect Rate to organization defined limit. (Also required by O121-C2-019100/SRG-APP-000245-DB-000132)

The connection rate limiter feature in Oracle Net Listener enables a database administrator to limit the number of new connections handled by the listener. When this feature is enabled, Oracle Net Listener imposes a user-specified maximum limit on the number of new connections handled by the listener every second.

CONNECTION_RATE_LISTENER=10
LISTENER=
(ADDRESS_LIST=
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1521)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1522)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1526))
)


10. Setup Valid Node Checking.
(See also O121-BP-025600.)

Valid node checking is a security feature that protects DBMS instances from malevolent or errant Oracle Net connections over TCP/IP, without the need for a firewall or IP address filtering at the operating system-level. The feature is controlled by the three parameters; tcp.validnode_checking, tcp.invited_nodes, and tcp.excluded_nodes.

Modify the sqlnet.ora file manually
TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING=yes

If this parameter is set to yes, then incoming connections are allowed only if they originate from a node that conforms to the list specified by TCP.INVITED_NODES or TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters.

The TCP.INVITED_NODES and TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters are valid only when the TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING parameter is set to yes (no is the default).

The TCP.INVITED_NODES and TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters are valid only when the TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING parameter is set to yes.

Modify the listener.ora file manually

TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES Syntax:
TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)

Example:
TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(finance.us.example.com, mktg.us.example.com, 192.0.2.25, 172.30.*, 2001:DB8:200C:417A/32)

TCP.INVITED_NODES Syntax:
TCP.INVITED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)

Example:
TCP.INVITED_NODES=(sales.us.example.com, hr.us.example.com, 192.0.*, 2001:DB8:200C:433B/32)

Usage Notes:

Use TCP.INVITED_NODES to specify which clients are allowed access to the database. This list takes precedence over the TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameter if both lists are present. These parameters can use wildcards for IPv4 addresses and CIDR notation for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.


11. Apply Listener Security Patches.
(See also O121-C1-011100/SRG-APP-000133-DB-000205.)

Critical Patch Updates are cumulative. Therefore, the latest patch will contain all previous security patches for the Listener.


12. Ensure that listener logging is turned on.

Listener logging is on by default. If logging is not on, configure logging for all listeners in order to capture Listener commands and brute force password attacks.


13. Monitor the listener logfile.

The logfile may contain TNS-01169, TNS-01189, TNS-01190, or TNS-12508 errors, which may signify attacks or inappropriate activity. Monitor the logfile and generate an alert whenever these errors are encountered.</fixtext><fix id="F-67731r7_fix" /><check system="C-62695r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review DBMS settings and custom database code to determine whether the DBMS or database application code could be used to launch DoS attacks.

SQL queries have the potential to consume large amounts of CPU cycles if they are not tuned for optimal performance. Web services containing complex calculations requiring large amounts of time to complete can bog down if too many requests for the service are encountered within a short period of time.

The methods employed to meet this requirement will vary depending upon the technology the application utilizes. However, a variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of application-related DoS incidents. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with specialized application layer protection devices and service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS problems.

Databases are particularly susceptible to SQL-related DoS issues. Databases that do not protect against resource-intensive SQL queries may experience dramatic slowdowns from malicious attacks or accidental DoS incidents related to SQL queries.  What constitutes a resource-intensive query has to be determined locally, taking into account the purpose of the database and the needs of the various classes of user.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001095</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67733r8_fix">Configure Oracle profile(s) to set resource limits appropriate to each class of user.

To implement security at the user level, assign users a profile that limits their resources:

The user profile, ORA_STIG_PROFILE, has been provided (starting with Oracle 12.1.0.2) to satisfy the STIG requirements pertaining to the profile parameters. Oracle recommends that this profile be customized with any site-specific requirements and assigned to all users where applicable.  Note: It remains necessary to create a customized replacement for the password validation function, ORA12C_STRONG_VERIFY_FUNCTION, if relying on this technique to verify password complexity.

Example

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba

This capability is available in Oracle at both the user and database level.

At the user level, we create resource profiles for users of the database.

Resource Parameters
SESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to which to limit the user.
CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.
CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.
CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.
IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.
LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).
PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA).
COMPOSITE_LIMIT - Specify the total resource cost for a session, expressed in service units.

To check the resource controls assigned to a user, query the DBA_PROFILES and DBA_USERS tables in the following manner.

set linesize 121
col username format a20
col profile format a20
col resource_name format a25
col resource_type format a14
col limit format a10
select a.username,

SQL*Plus is an essential part of any Oracle installation.  SQL*Plus cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password.  Since the typical SQL*Plus user is a database administrator, the consequences of password compromise are particularly serious.  Therefore, the use of plain-text passwords must be prohibited, as a matter of practice and procedure.

Consider wrapping the startup command with a shell or wrapper and using an Oracle external password store.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

  For example:

  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:
orapki create -wallet wallet_location  -auto_login_local

For example:
orapki wallet create -wallet c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -auto_login_local
Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.

The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.

2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:
mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
Enter password: password

For example:
mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\12.1.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
Enter password: password

In this specification:
The wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.

The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.

The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.

3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1.  For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and the Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into the client sqlnet.ora file:

    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
           )
          )

4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set

        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin)
              )
             )

        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION =1.2 or 1.1

Note: ""SSL_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.1" is the actual value, not a suggestion to use one or the other."</fixtext><fix id="F-67761r2_fix" /><check system="C-62725r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>For Oracle SQL*Plus, which cannot be configured not to accept a plain-text password, and any other essential tool with the same limitation, verify that the system documentation explains the need for the tool, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations; and that AO approval has been obtained.

"If default account names are not changed, an attacker has a predefined list of accounts to target.  Since most default accounts are administrative in nature, the compromise of a default account can have catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over the information system."

However, Oracle does not provide for changing user names directly.  Workarounds to achieve the effect of a name change are cumbersome.

The inclusion of role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, the application must support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to organization-defined lists of security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (non-security) system functions.

Use of privileged accounts for non-administrative purposes puts data at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure. In particular, DBA accounts if used for non-administration application development or application maintenance can lead to miss-assignment of privileges where privileges are inherited by object owners. It may also lead to loss or compromise of application data where the elevated privileges bypass controls designed in and provided by applications.

The DBMS software installation account may require privileges not required for database administration or other functions. Use of accounts configured with excess privileges may result in the loss or compromise of data or system settings due to elevated privileges that bypass controls designed to protect them.

This requirement is particularly important because Oracle equates the installation account with the SYS account - the super-DBA.  Once logged on to the operating system, this account can connect to the database AS SYSDBA without further authentication.

Audit trail type can be 'OS', 'DB', 'DB,EXTENDED', 'XML' or 'XML,EXTENDED'.
After executing this statement, it may be necessary to shut down and restart the Oracle database.

If Unified Auditing is used:

If the site-specific audit requirements are not covered by the default audit options, deploy and configure Fine-Grained Auditing.  For details, refer to Oracle documentation at the locations above.

If this level of auditing does not meet site-specific requirements, consider deploying the Oracle Audit Vault.  The Audit Vault is a highly configurable option from Oracle made specifically for performing the audit functions.  It has reporting capabilities as well as user-defined rules that provide additional flexibility for complex auditing requirements.</fixtext><fix id="F-67803r2_fix" /><check system="C-62767r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>If there are no shared accounts available to more than one user, this is not a finding.

Before a security review is conducted, information systems and/or applications with an audit reduction capability may remove many audit records known to have little security significance. This is generally accomplished by removing records generated by specified classes of events, such as records generated by nightly backups.

In order to identify and report on what (repetitive) data has been removed via the use of audit reduction, the application must provide a capability to generate reports containing what values were removed by the audit reduction.

Audit reduction does not alter original audit records. An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy-based requirements and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents.

Reporting tools employing audit reduction methods must not alter the original audit data. An example of a tool employing audit reduction methods is the Windows Event Viewer tool which is used to view and analyze audit logs on Windows systems.

The lack of reporting tools for audit reduction can require the DBA, or others responsible for reviewing audit logs, to sort through large amounts of data in order to find relevant records.  This can cause important audit records to be missed.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 12c</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 12c</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2679</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000157</ident><fixtext fixref="F-67889r1_fix">Deploy software capable of performing audit data reduction and of reporting on the excluded audit data.</fixtext><fix id="F-67889r1_fix" /><check system="C-62851r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_12c_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Verify that audit reduction capabilities are in place for the Oracle audit data.
