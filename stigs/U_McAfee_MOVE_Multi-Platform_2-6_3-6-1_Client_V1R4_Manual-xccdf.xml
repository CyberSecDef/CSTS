If the system does not have the McAfee Agent deployed to it, this is a finding.

If the McAfee Agent is running on the system, next confirm the system has the McAfee MOVE AV Client deployed and is being managed by the ePO server:
Access a cmd window, running as administrator. 
Navigate to the directory to which the McAfee Agent is installed (default is C:\Program Files (x86)\McAfee\Common Framework).
Open the McAfee Agent status monitor by executing the following command:
cmdagent /s &lt;enter&gt;

In the McAfee Agent Monitor, click the "Check New Policies" button. In the McAfee Agent Monitor, review the Agent Subsystem status lines and ensure there is a status for "Agent started performing ASCI", followed by a sequence of status lines showing the "Agent is sending PROPS VERSION package to ePO server" and "Agent communication session closed". These status lines will confirm the system is making a successful connection to the ePO server.

Click the "Enforce Policies" button. In the McAfee Agent Monitor, review the Management status lines and ensure one shows a status of "Enforcing Policies for MOVEVOFF2600". This status line will confirm the system is enforcing policies for the McAfee MOVE AV Client.

If McAfee Agent Status Monitor shows successful Agent Subsystem status lines of "Agent started performing ASCI", followed by a sequence of status lines showing the "Agent is sending PROPS VERSION package to ePO server" and "Agent communication session closed" and a Management status line of "Enforcing Policies for MOVEVOFF2600", this is not a finding.

The antivirus software should then perform a complete scan of the host to identify any potential infections. To support the security of the host, the antivirus software should be configured and maintained properly so it continues to be effective at detecting and stopping malware. Antivirus software is most effective when its signatures are fully up-to-date.
