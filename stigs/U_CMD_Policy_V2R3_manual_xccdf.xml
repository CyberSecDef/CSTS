This requirement applies to mobile operating system (OS) CMDs.

This requirement also applies to sensitive DoD information stored on mobile OS devices that are not authorized to connect to DoD networks or store/process sensitive DoD information. Sensitive DoD data or information is defined as any data/information that has not been approved for public release by the site/Command Public Affairs Officer (PAO).

In accordance with DoD policy, all components must establish Incident Handling and Response procedures. A CMI or “data spill” occurs when a classified email is inadvertently sent on an unclassified network and received on a wireless email device. Classified information may also be transmitted through some other form of file transfer to include web browser downloads and files transferred through tethered connections. CMDs are not authorized for processing classified data. 

A data spill also occurs if a classified document is attached to an otherwise unclassified email. For BlackBerry and Good Mobile Messaging systems, a data spill will only occur if the classified attached document is viewed or opened by the CMD user since the CMD system only downloads an attachment on the CMD if the user views or opens the attachment. The site's Incident Handling and Response procedures should reference NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12, Section 5, for smartphone destruction procedures. 

Check Procedures: 
Interview the IAO. Verify classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are documented in site CMD procedures or security policies. Mark as a finding if classified incident handling, response, and reporting procedures are not documented in site CMD procedures or security policies.

This requirement applies at both sites where CMDs are issued and managed and at sites where the CMD management server is located.

---At the CMD management server site, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions to sanitize the CMD management server and email servers (e.g., Exchange, Oracle mail). 

---At CMD sites, verify Incident Handling and Response procedures include actions for incident reporting and actions to safeguard classified smartphone devices. The following actions will be followed for all CMDs involved in a data spill:

-BlackBerry CMDs: follow procedures in the DoD Data Spill Procedures Guide for BlackBerry Smartphones located at http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/net_perimeter/wireless/smartphone.html. 

-Windows Mobile, Android, and iOS CMDs: the CMD will be destroyed.

Mark as a finding if Incident Handling and Response procedures do not include required information.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-24957"><title>Site must follow required data spill procedures</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-30694r3_rule" severity="high" weight="10.0"><version>WIR-SPP-003-02</version><title>If a data spill (Classified Message Incident (CMI)) occurs on a wireless email device or system at a site, the site must follow required data spill procedures. </title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;If required procedures are not followed after a data spill, classified data could be exposed to unauthorized personnel.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;System Administrator&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;VIIR-1, VIIR-2&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>VMS Target Smartphone Handheld Policy</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>VMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Smartphone Handheld Policy</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1978</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-27583r4_fix">Follow required procedures after a data spill occurs.</fixtext><fix id="F-27583r4_fix" /><check system="C-31115r3_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_CMD Policy STIG.xml" /><check-content>Detailed Policy Requirements:

Sensitive DoD data or information is defined as any data/information that has not been approved for public release by the site/Command Public Affairs Officer (PAO).

If a data spill occurs on a CMD, the following actions must be completed: 

- The CMD management server and email servers (i.e., Exchange, Oracle mail, etc.) are handled as classified systems until they are sanitized according to appropriate procedures. (See NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-12 for sanitization procedures.)

- The CMD is handled as a classified device and destroyed according to DoD guidance for destroying classified equipment or sanitized as directed in Check WIR-SPP-003-01.

Check Procedures: 
Interview the IAO. Determine if the site has had a data spill within the previous 24 months. If yes, review written records, incident reports, and/or after action reports and determine if required procedures were followed.

Core applications are applications included in the mobile device operating system. Applications added by the wireless carrier are not considered core applications. A security risk analysis must be performed by the DAA or DAA approved approval authority prior to a mobile OS application being approved for use.

- Since the native cryptographic module included in iOS is not FIPS 140-2 validated, non-core applications can only be approved if they meet the following conditions:
-- The application does not synchronize or store any sensitive data locally on the device; or
-- The application synchronizes and stores sensitive data locally on the device and the data-at-rest, as well as, data-in-transit is encrypted using a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module. 


- The application review and approval process must include an evaluation of what OS level permissions are required by the application and how the application shares data and memory space with other applications. The review process must also ensure:
- Approved applications do not contain malware or share data stored on the mobile OS device with non-DoD servers.

Check Procedures:

Review this check after reviewing check WIR-SPP-020. Determine if any non-core mobile OS applications have been approved by the DAA. 
- If no, this check is not applicable.

- If yes, complete the following procedures:

Ask the site for documentation showing what security risk analysis procedures are used by the DAA prior to approving non-core applications for use.

Determine if the procedures include an evaluation of the following:
- What OS level permissions are required by the application? 
- The application does not contain malware.
- The application does not share data stored on the CMDs with non-DoD servers.
- If the application stores sensitive data, the application data storage container uses FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module.

- Mark as a finding if a security review was not conducted on approved applications or the application security risk review procedures do not contain the required risk assessment evaluation tasks.</check-content></check></Rule></Group></Benchmark>
