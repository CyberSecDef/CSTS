If the appropriate controls include placing the data in a read-only tablespace, proceed as follows.

After we figure out the tablespace the data object is stored in:
$ sqlplus connect as sysdba
SQL&gt; SELECT table_name, tablespace_name from dba_tables where upper(table_name) like &amp;tablename_from_developer;

Once we get the name of the tablespace where all of the important data is stored, alter the tablespace to be read-only.  
SQL&gt; ALTER TABLESPACE &amp;tablespace_where_data_is READ ONLY;

For better performance while accessing data in a read-only tablespace, you can issue a query that accesses all of the blocks of the tables in the tablespace just before making it read-only. A simple query, such as SELECT COUNT (*), executed against each table ensures that the data blocks in the tablespace can be subsequently accessed most efficiently. This eliminates the need for the database to check the status of the transactions that most recently modified the blocks.  You can issue the ALTER TABLESPACE...READ ONLY statement while the database is processing transactions. After the statement is issued, the tablespace is put into a transitional read-only state. No transactions are allowed to make further changes (using DML statements) to the tablespace. If a transaction attempts further changes, it is terminated and rolled back. However, transactions that already made changes and that attempt no further changes are allowed to commit or roll back.  If a transaction started before the statement remains active, but rolls back to a savepoint, rolling back its changes to the tablespace, then the statement no longer waits for this active transaction.</fixtext><fix id="F-56947r1_fix" /><check system="C-54189r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Determine whether the database houses and distributes information to the public.

All of the permissions and policies we would employ to protect information would be in play, like access control mechanisms, auditing, and password protection.  For data that is for display or download to the public for their informational needs, it may be appropriate to place the data in a read-only tablespace.  This will provide the DBA with the ability to modify content as needed by modifying the tablespace from read-only to read-write in the event the content needs to be modified.  Check with the Application Developer to see what tables are used to store the data and/or content that is displayed to the public.  Then find the tablespace name the data objects are stored in.

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user's session.   Applications will make application decisions and execute business logic based on the session ID. Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attackers are unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the application must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.

Database sessions must be terminated when no longer in use in order to prevent session hijacking.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001185</ident><fixtext fixref="F-56949r2_fix">Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon user logout.  Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon the occurrence of any organization or policy-defined session termination event.
- - - - -
To configure specific session termination processes we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event.  Below are some examples.

Oracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter.

You can use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with "alter profile" statements:

alter profile senior_claim_analyst limit
   connect_time 180000
   sessions_per_user 2
   ldle_time 1800;

Profiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when you create users, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources.

The syntax to create a profile follows:

CREATE PROFILE  LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;
Resource_parameters: 
 [SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [CPU_PER_SESSION   n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]    
 [CPU_PER_CALL      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]           
 [CONNECT_TIME      n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
 [IDLE_TIME         n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]

By setting resource limits, you can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. You can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.

The system resource limits can be enforced at the session-level, the call level, or both. The session-level is calculated from the time the user logs in to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.

Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME

The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If you need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), you should set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.

When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:

sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.     

The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.

Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.

Turning-on expire_time

To set up these advanced features, simply edit your sqlnet.ora file.  If you are a beginner, follow this procedure:

Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.

In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local &gt; Profile.
     
From the list on the right hand pane, select General.

Click on the Advanced tab.
     
Next, enter the values for the fields or options you want to set.  

When you are finished, choose File &gt; Save Network Configuration to write your changes to the sqlnet.ora file.

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.

Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.

To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, you should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.)  Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error.</fixtext><fix id="F-56949r2_fix" /><check system="C-54191r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review DBMS settings and vendor documentation to verify user sessions are terminated upon user logout. If they are not, this is a finding.

Review system documentation and organization policy to identify other events that should result in session terminations. If other session termination events are defined, review DBMS settings to verify occurrences of these events would cause session termination. If occurrences of defined session-terminating events do not cause session terminations, this is a finding.

When a user logs out of an Oracle session gracefully or has the session terminated for an idle timeout or any other reason, the session is terminated, and the resources are returned to the system.  Check with the DBA to see what mechanism is used to disconnect the session and what events the site uses to determine if a connection needs to be terminated.  

To test for timeout, open a connection and leave it idle for a period greater than the defined idle timeout setting enforced by the system.  Then try to use the connection.  If the connection is no longer active, then the mechanism deployed to terminate the connection is active and working.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-52137"><title>SRG-APP-000221-DB-000150</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-66353r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O112-C2-017700</version><title>The DBMS must provide a logout functionality to allow the user to manually terminate the session.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Manually terminating an application session allows users to immediately depart the physical vicinity of the system they are logged into without the risk of subsequent system users reactivating or continuing their application session.

This is default behavior for the Oracle database.  To test this functionality, create a user named testuser1 as SYSDBA and grant connect to testuser1.  The V$SESSION is the place where all of the sessions that are established with the database are tracked, so we can count the number of active sessions by counting the rows in that table.

Initiate session one

sqlplus connect sysdba

SQL&gt;select count(*) from v$session
count (*) 
---------
       26

Then connect as a different user in a second terminal session and after successfully connecting, issue the select count(*) command again and the number should increase by one, then have user1 exit the session.  If you have the SYSDBA do another select count(*) from v$session, you will see the session count will go down by 1.  When a session no longer exists, the resources are de-allocated.

sqlplus connect as user1

Failure in a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system. 

Failure in a known safe state helps prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause loss of data or unauthorized access to system resources. Applications or systems that fail suddenly and with no incorporated failure state planning may leave the hosting system available but with a reduced security protection capability. Preserving information system state information also facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes.

Enabling Constraints Upon Definition
The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ) ;
ALTER TABLE emp
    ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because existing rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. In this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.

Oracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints.

Integrity Constraint States
You can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE). If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered or updated in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.

Additionally, you can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if you specify NOVALIDATE, you are not ensured that existing data conforms.

An integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states:
    ENABLE, VALIDATE
    ENABLE, NOVALIDATE
    DISABLE, VALIDATE
    DISABLE, NOVALIDATE

For details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, see the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.

Disabling Constraints
To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:

-    When loading large amounts of data into a table

-    When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number)

-    When importing or exporting one table at a time

In all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.

It is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, you should always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.

Enabling Constraints
While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the enable nonvalidated state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.

You can identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. See "Reporting Constraint Exceptions". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which you can examine.

Enable Nonvalidate Constraint State
When a constraint is in the enable nonvalidate state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with enable nonvalidated constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Enabling constraints in the nonvalidated state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.

Enabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint nonvalidate is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating enables you to reduce the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.

Efficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure

Using integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:
    Disable state.
    Perform the operation (load, export, import).
    Enable nonvalidate state.
    Enable state.

Some benefits of using constraints in this order are:
    No locks are held.
    All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.
    Constraint enabling is done in parallel.
    Concurrent activity on table is permitted.

Setting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition
When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by your specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.

Disabling Constraints Upon Definition
The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
   ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.
Enabling Constraints Upon Definition

The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:

CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY,   . . . ;

ALTER TABLE emp
    ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);

An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. If this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.

When you enable a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint an associated index is created.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-52167"><title>SRG-APP-000108-DB-000048</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-66383r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O112-C2-008500</version><title>The DBMS must alert designated organizational officials in the event of an audit processing failure.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required.

This is generally accomplished by removing records generated by specified classes of events, such as records generated by nightly backups. 

An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy requirements regarding what must be audited on the system and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. It is important to recognize audit reduction does not alter original audit records.  

Audit reduction and reporting tools do not alter original audit records. 

To leverage the complete capability of audit reduction, the application must possess the ability to specify and automatically process certain event criteria that are selectable in nature. In other words, a system administrator (SA) may be performing a manual review of audit data to identify a particular problem. The SA has determined that backup activity and network connections from a particular host comprise the bulk of the events. However, these events are not related to the activity being investigated. The application must be able to automatically process these audit records for audit reduction purposes rather than making the administrator manually process them. 

The lack of audit reduction and reporting in a database can require the DBA, or others responsible for reviewing audit logs, to sort through large amounts of data in order to find relevant records.  This can cause important audit records to be missed.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000158</ident><fixtext fixref="F-56985r1_fix">Utilize a DBMS or separate application that provides the ability to automatically process audit records for events based on selectable event criteria.

This can be accomplished by using Oracle Audit Vault and/or Oracle Enterprise Manager. If neither of these products is deployed then develop a site-specific solution.

Notes to assist in developing a site-specific solution:

The AUD$ table has a column called RETURNCODE.  That column provides the return code, so, for example, if the security-related condition is someone trying to select data from a table that is not there, it would show up in the AUD$ table as an ORA-00942 - table or view does not exist.  Since the RETURNCODE column is only numeric, only the 00942 would be stored. If the query for the information returned a row, the process would then need to form and send an email message.  

Oracle recommends the use of Oracle Audit Vault to fill this requirement without creating a custom solution.   It is possible to set up notifications and alerts in Enterprise Manager as well, and if either of these alternatives is not available, a custom solution will be necessary.</fixtext><fix id="F-56991r1_fix" /><check system="C-54231r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Check DBMS settings to determine whether security-related error conditions are monitored for, and whether appropriate personnel are notified.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized access. This includes read, write, copy, etc.

This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design. Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections and limiting log data location.

Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who should not have access to it.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and you want to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that you use for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees


SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; 

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list] 

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) 

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. You can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

You can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: You cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if you have other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see "SQL standard authorization" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges
    All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges
    Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

Revoke examples
To revoke the SELECT privilege on table t from the authorization IDs 'Maria' and 'Harry', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM maria,harry 

To revoke the UPDATE and TRIGGER privileges on table t from the authorization IDs 'Anita' and 'Zhi', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE, TRIGGER ON TABLE t FROM anita,zhi 

To revoke the SELECT privilege on table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the UPDATE privilege on columns c1 and c2 of table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE (c1,c2) ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the EXECUTE privilege on procedure p from the authorization ID 'George', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE p FROM george RESTRICT</fixtext><fix id="F-56993r1_fix" /><check system="C-54233r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review locations of audit logs, both internal to the database and database audit logs located at the operating system-level.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges
    All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges
    Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

Revoke examples
To revoke the SELECT privilege on table t from the authorization IDs 'Maria' and 'Harry', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM maria,harry 

To revoke the UPDATE and TRIGGER privileges on table t from the authorization IDs 'Anita' and 'Zhi', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE, TRIGGER ON TABLE t FROM anita,zhi 

To revoke the SELECT privilege on table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the UPDATE privilege on columns c1 and c2 of table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE (c1,c2) ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the EXECUTE privilege on procedure p from the authorization ID 'George', use the following syntax:
SQL&gt;REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE p FROM george RESTRICT</fixtext><fix id="F-56999r1_fix" /><check system="C-54239r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review locations of audit logs, both internal to the database and database audit logs located at the operating system-level.

Some commonly employed methods include:  ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections; restricting access; and backing up log data to ensure log data is retained.  

Applications providing a user interface to audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the data and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding the deletion of audit data.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who you do not want to have access to the AUD$ table.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and you want to revoke that access use the following command. The syntax that you use for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees


SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; 

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |
  INSERT |
  REFERENCES [column list] |
  SELECT [column list] |
  TRIGGER |
  UPDATE [column list] 

column list

  ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) 

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. You can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.
grantees

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

You can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: You cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends on is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if you have other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see "SQL standard authorization" in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges
    All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges
    Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

    When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

    When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

Revoke examples
To revoke the SELECT privilege on table t from the authorization IDs 'Maria' and 'Harry', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM maria,harry 

To revoke the UPDATE and TRIGGER privileges on table t from the authorization IDs 'Anita' and 'Zhi', use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE, TRIGGER ON TABLE t FROM anita,zhi 

To revoke the SELECT privilege on table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the UPDATE privilege on columns c1 and c2 of table s.v from all users, use the following syntax:

SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE (c1,c2) ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC

To revoke the EXECUTE privilege on procedure p from the authorization ID 'George', use the following syntax:
SQL&gt;REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE p FROM george RESTRICT</fixtext><fix id="F-57005r1_fix" /><check system="C-54245r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review locations of audit logs, both internal to the database and database audit logs located at the operating system-level.

Accounts are utilized for identifying individual application users or for identifying the application processes themselves. 

In order to detect and respond to events that affect user accessibility and application processing, applications must notify the appropriate individuals when an account is terminated so they can investigate the event. Such a capability greatly reduces the risk that application accessibility will be negatively affected for extended periods of time and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes. 

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

However, notwithstanding how accounts are managed, the DBMS must support the requirement to notify appropriate individuals upon account termination.

Separation of duties requires that the person accountable for approving an action is not the same person who is tasked with implementing or carrying out that action.  

Additionally, the person or entity accountable for monitoring the activity must be separate as well. To meet this requirement, applications, when applicable, shall be divided where functionality is based on roles and duties. Examples of separation of duties include: (i) mission functions and distinct information system support functions are divided among different individuals/roles; (ii) different individuals perform information system support functions (e.g., system management, systems programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, network security); (iii) security personnel who administer access control functions do not administer audit functions; and (iv) different administrator accounts for different roles.  

Privileges granted outside the role of the application user job function are more likely to go unmanaged or without oversight for authorization.

If the check revealed that auditing is enabled and the tablespace holding the audit table is encrypted, there is no fix required.

If auditing is not enabled, use the following steps to enable auditing.

sqlplus connect as sysdba

Turn on Oracle audit
 
a. If the database uses an spfile

SQL&gt; alter system set audit_trail=DB,EXTENDED scope=spfile ;
System altered.

b. if database uses pfile, modify init&lt;Sid&gt;.ora directly.
For these changes to take place, the database must be restarted.


Next we create an encrypted tablespace. Before you can encrypt or decrypt tablespaces, you must generate or set a master encryption key. The tablespace master encryption key is stored in an external security module and is used to encrypt the TDE tablespace encryption keys.

Check to ensure that the ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION (or WALLET_LOCATION) parameter in the sqlnet.ora file points to the correct software wallet location. For example:

ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION=
  (SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=
   (DIRECTORY=/app/wallet)))

Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2) uses the same master encryption key for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. When you issue the ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY command, a unified master encryption key is created for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. 

Resetting the Tablespace Master Encryption Key

Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2) uses a unified master encryption key for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. When you reset (rekey) the master encryption key for TDE column encryption, the master encryption key for TDE tablespace encryption also gets reset.  The ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY command resets the tablespace master encryption key. Before you can create an encrypted tablespace, the Oracle wallet containing the tablespace master encryption key must be open. The wallet must also be open before you can access data in an encrypted tablespace. The security administrator needs to open the Oracle wallet after starting the Oracle instance. A restart of the Oracle instance requires the security administrator to open the wallet again.  The security administrator also needs to open the wallet before performing database recovery operations. This is because background processes may require access to encrypted redo and undo logs. When performing database recovery, the wallet must be opened before opening the database. This is illustrated in the following statements:

SQL&gt; STARTUP MOUNT;
SQL&gt; ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION WALLET OPEN IDENTIFIED BY "password";
SQL&gt; ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

You can also choose to use auto login wallets, if your environment does not require the extra security provided by a wallet that needs to be explicitly opened. However, this is not the recommended practice.

Creating an Encrypted Tablespace

The CREATE TABLESPACE command enables you to create an encrypted tablespace. The permanent_tablespace_clause enables you to choose the encryption algorithm and the key length for encryption. The ENCRYPT keyword in the storage_clause encrypts the tablespace. The following syntax illustrates this:

CREATE
   [ BIGFILE | SMALLFILE ]
   { permanent_tablespace_clause
   | temporary_tablespace_clause
   | undo_tablespace_clause
   } ;

Where, permanent_tablespace_clause=TABLESPACE , ENCRYPTION [USING algorithm] storage_clause
Where, storage_clause=[ENCRYPT] where:
   The encryption algorithm can have one of the following values:

      3DES168
      AES128
      AES192
      AES256

The key lengths are included in the names of the algorithms themselves. If no encryption algorithm is specified, the default encryption algorithm is used. The default encryption algorithm is AES128.
Note: The ENCRYPTION keyword in the permanent_tablespace_clause is used to specify the encryption algorithm. The ENCRYPT keyword in the storage_clause actually encrypts the tablespace.  For security reasons, a tablespace cannot be encrypted with the NO SALT option.
  

Commands to create Encrypted Tablespace

      CREATE TABLESPACE securespace
      DATAFILE '/home/user/oradata/secure01.dbf'
      SIZE 150M
      ENCRYPTION USING '3DES168'
      DEFAULT STORAGE(ENCRYPT);

This creates a tablespace called securespace2 using an algorithm of 3DES168.

You cannot encrypt an existing tablespace. However, you can import data into an encrypted tablespace using the Oracle Data Pump utility. You can also use SQL commands like CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT...or ALTER TABLE...MOVE... to move data into an encrypted tablespace. The CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT... command enables you to create a table from an existing table. The ALTER TABLE...MOVE... command enables you to move a table into the encrypted tablespace.

Then we move the sys.aud$ from system tablespace to securespace tablespace. 

SQL&gt; exec DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(audit_trail_type =&gt; DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD, audit_trail_location_value =&gt; 'securespace');

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

Then check the tablespace the table is stored in. 

SQL&gt; SELECT table_name, tablespace_name FROM dba_tables WHERE table_name ='AUD$';

Now we know if auditing is enabled. Next we need to see what tablespace the AUD$ table is in.  

SQL&gt;  SELECT table_name, tablespace_name FROM dba_tables WHERE table_name ='AUD$';
 
TABLE_NAME     TABLESPACE_NAME

AUD$           SYSTEM

Now we know what auditing is set to and the tablespace auditing is deployed in.

Now we can check to see if the tablespace the AUD$ table is located in is encrypted by querying DBA_TABLESPACES.  When prompted, use the tablespace name listed above.

SQL&gt; set linesize 121
SQL&gt; col tablespace_name format a20
SQL&gt; col encrypted       format a3
SQL&gt; select tablespace_name, encrypted from dba_tablespaces where tablespace_name = '&amp;tablespace_name';
The following data dictionary views maintain information about the encryption status of a tablespace. You can query these views to verify that a tablespace has been encrypted.

If the tablespace containing the AUD$ table is not encrypted, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-52213"><title>SRG-APP-000114-DB-000054</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-66429r1_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>O112-C3-008800</version><title>The DBMS must provide a report generation capability for audit reduction data.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;In support of Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting requirements, audit reduction is a technique used to reduce the volume of audit records in order to facilitate a manual review.  

Before a security review is conducted, information systems and/or applications with an audit reduction capability may remove many audit records known to have little security significance. This is generally accomplished by removing records generated by specified classes of events, such as records generated by nightly backups. 

In order to identify and report on what (repetitive) data has been removed via the use of audit reduction, the application must provide a capability to generate reports containing what values were removed by the audit reduction. 

Audit reduction does not alter original audit records. An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy-based requirements and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. 

Reporting tools employing audit reduction methods must not alter the original audit data. An example of a tool employing audit reduction methods is the Windows Event Viewer tool which is used to view and analyze audit logs on Windows systems.

The lack of reporting tools for audit reduction can require the DBA, or others responsible for reviewing audit logs, to sort through large amounts of data in order to find relevant records.

While it is true that those accountable for systems want to ensure they are not affected by a DoS attack, they also need to ensure their systems and applications are not used to launch such an attack against others. To that extent, a variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks.

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices from being directly affected by  DoS attacks. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks.

Applications and application developers must take the steps needed to ensure users cannot use these applications to launch DoS attacks against other systems and networks. An example would be designing applications to include mechanisms that throttle network traffic so users are not able to generate unlimited network traffic via the application.

Secure the Oracle Listener in 15 steps:

1. DISABLING THE DEFAULT LISTENER
2. SET THE LISTENER PASSWORD
3. TURN ON LISTENER LOGGING
4. SET ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS IN THE LISTENER.ORA
5. SET LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION IN THE LISTENER.ORA
6. SET PROTECTION AGAINST CRAFTED NETWORK PACKETS ON DATABASE LEVEL IN 11G.
7. APPLY LISTENER SECURITY PATCHES
8. BLOCK SQL*NET ON FIREWALLS
9. SECURE THE $TNS_ADMIN DIRECTORY
10. SECURE TNSLSNR AND LSNRCTL EXECUTABLES
11. REMOVE UNUSED SERVICES
12. CHANGE THE TNS PORT NUMBER DEFAULT
13. SETUP VALID NODE CHECKING
14. MONITOR THE LOGFILE
15. SET CONNECTION RATE
   
Step 1 - Disable the Default Listener
All listeners have a name instead of the name LISTENER and have a startup protection.
LISTENER=(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST=)(PORT = 0)))

This configuration prevents the default listener from starting. The error serves as a reminder to set TNS_ADMIN, if necessary, and to supply the correct listener name to the lsnrctl command.
$ lsnrctl start
...
Connecting to (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=)(PORT=0)))
TNS-01103: Protocol specific component of the address is incorrectly specified
TNS-12533: TNS:illegal ADDRESS parameters
TNS-12560: TNS:protocol adapter error
TNS-00503: Illegal ADDRESS parameters

Step 2 - Set the Listener Password
Set the Listener password to stop most attacks and security issues. Setting the password manually in listener.ora using the PASSWORDS_ parameter will result in the password being stored in cleartext.

LSNRCTL&gt; set current_listener
LSNRCTL&gt; change_password Old password:
New password:
Reenter new password:
LSNRCTL&gt; set password :
LSNRCTL&gt; save_config

Check the listener.ora

Step 3 - Turn on Logging
Turn on logging for all listeners in order to capture Listener commands and brute force password attacks.
LSNRCTL&gt; set current_listener
LSNRCTL&gt; set password :
LSNRCTL&gt; set log_directory /network/admin
LSNRCTL&gt; set log_file .log
LSNRCTL&gt; set log_status on
LSNRCTL&gt; save_config

Step 4 - Set ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS in the listener.ora
With ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_listener=on, the listener rejects SET commands that might have been sent from an intruder on a remote system. It only allows changes through lsnrctl reload on the local system LISTENER.ORA.
ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_ = ON

Step 5 - Set LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION in the listener.ora
By default, the Listener cannot be remotely managed and can only be managed locally by the owner of the tnslsnr process (usually oracle) since Oracle 10G.
LOCAL_OS_AUTHENTICATION_ = ON

Step 6 - Set Protection against crafted network packets on database level in 11g.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION:
SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION specifies the action that the database should take when bad packets are received from a possibly malicious client.
SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION = { NONE | TRACE | LOG | ALERT }

NONE: The database server ignores the bad packets and does not generate any trace files or log messages.

TRACE: A detailed trace file is generated when bad packets are received, which can be used to debug any problems in client/server communication.

LOG: A minimal log message is printed in the alert logfile and in the server trace file. A minimal amount of disk space is used.

ALERT: An alert message is sent to a DBA or monitoring console.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION
SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION specifies the further execution of a server process when receiving bad packets from a possibly malicious client.
SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION = { CONTINUE | (DELAY,integer) | (DROP,integer) }

CONTINUE: The server process continues execution. The database server may be subject to a Denial of Service (DoS) if bad packets continue to be sent by a malicious client.

(DELAY,integer):The client experiences a delay of integer seconds before the server process accepts the next request from the same client connection. Malicious clients are prevented from excessive consumption of server resources while legitimate clients experience degradation in performance but can continue to function.

(DROP,integer): The server forcefully terminates the client connection after integer bad packets. The server protects itself at the expense of the client (for example, a client transaction may be lost). The client may reconnect and attempt the same operation.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
specifies the number of authentication attempts that can be made by a client on a connection to the server process. After the specified number of failure attempts, the connection will be automatically dropped by the server process.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = n (10 is the default)

Values ranges 1 to unlimited

Step 7 - Apply Listener Security Patches
Critical Patch Updates are cumulative, therefore, the latest patch will contain all previous security patches for the Listener.

Step 8 - Block SQL*Net on Firewalls
Firewall filters should be designed to only allow SQL*Net traffic from known application and web servers. SQL*Net traffic from application servers in the DMZ should be permitted only to access specific database servers.

Step 9 - Secure the $TNS_ADMIN Directory
Place the listener.ora, sqlnet.ora, and protocol.ora files in the $TNS_ADMIN directory.

It should be read/write/execute for only the primary oracle account and no permissions for any other account (for UNIX and Linux 0600). The tnsnames.ora file permissions should be set to 0644 on UNIX and Linux.

Step 10 - Secure TNSLSNR and LSNRCTL executables
The executables tnslsnr and lsnrctl in the $ORACLE_HOME/bin should be protected. Set the file permissions to 0751 on UNIX and Linux as recommended by Oracle. It is possible to change the file permissions to 0700 which would be more secure, although this should be thoroughly tested in your environment.

Step 11 - Remove Unused Services
Default installations have a listener entry for PL/SQL External Procedures (ExtProc or PLSExtProc) and databases with default services. Remove the Unused services from database or listener.

Step 12 - Change the TNS Port Number Default (1521)
Stop automated attacks and detection of the Listener in networks; the default NTS port number should be changed from 1521 to a port outside of the 1521-1550 and 1600-1699 ranges.

The database initialization parameter LOCAL_LISTENER must be set so that the database is able to dynamically register with the Listener. See Metalink Note ID 359277.1

Step 13 - Setup Valid Node Checking
Valid node checking is an interesting security feature that protects DBMS instances from malevolent or errant Oracle Net connections over TCP/IP, without the need for a firewall or IP address filtering at the operating system-level. The feature is controlled by the three parameters tcp.validnode_checking, tcp.invited_nodes, and tcp.excluded_nodes. Valid node checking could be enabled dynamically in Oracle10g and Oracle11g. This works only if the configuration file sqlnet.ora was present when the TNS Listener was started. There's no sense in setting both tcp.invited_nodes and tcp.excluded_nodes at the same time, since even nodes not mentioned explicitly as excluded nodes will still be excluded when tcp.invited_nodes is set.

tcp.validnode_checking

Turns valid node checking on or off
tcp.invited_nodes

List of nodes that may connect to the TNS Listener. A comma separated list of host names and/or IP addresses on a single line
tcp.excluded_nodes

List of nodes that are denied a connection to the TNS Listener. A comma-separated list of host names and/or IP addresses on a single line.

Step 14 - Monitor the logfile
The logfile may contain TNS-01169, TNS-01189, TNS-01190, or TNS-12508 errors, which may signify attacks or inappropriate activity, monitor the logfile and generate an alert whenever these errors are encountered.

Step 15 - Set Connect Rate
CONNECTION_RATE_LISTENER=10

LISTENER=
(ADDRESS_LIST=
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1521)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1522)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1526))
)
LISTENER=
(ADDRESS_LIST=
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1521)(RATE_LIMIT=8))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1522)(RATE_LIMIT=12))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1526))
)

You can assign a profile to a user when you create the user or by altering the user.  The syntax to alter the profile for a user is:
SQL&gt; ALTER USER PROFILE ; 

For example: 
SQL&gt;ALTER USER scott PROFILE appuser;

You must have the CREATE PROFILE system privilege to create a profile.  To alter a profile, you must be the creator of the profile or have the ALTER PROFILE system privilege.  To assign a profile to a user, you must have the CREATE USER or ALTER USER system privilege.

Profiles and Resource Limits
The default cost assigned to a resource is unlimited.  By setting resource limits, you can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations.  You can use resource limits for security to ensure that users log off the system and do not leave the session connected for long periods of time. You can also assign a composite cost to each profile . The system resource limits can be enforced at the session-level, the call level, or both.

The session-level is from the time the user logs into the database until the user exits.  The call level is for each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection.  When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back, and no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback or exit is performed. Table 7.15 lists the system resources which can be regulated at the session-level.

Note: if you use parallel query option (PQO), the resources are applied to each new session, not accumulated over all of the sessions that a parallel operation uses.

RESOURCES REGULATED AT THE session-level

SYSTEM RESOURCE               DEFINITION
----------------              -----------
CPU_PER_SESSION               total CPU time in hundredths of seconds
SESSIONS_PER_USER             number of concurrent sessions for a user
CONNECT_TIME                  allowed connection time in minutes
IDLE_TIME                     inactive time on the server in minutes
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION     number of data blocks read including both physical and logical reads from memory and disk
PRIVATE_SGA                   bytes of SGA used in a database with the multithreaded server (in K or M)

You can combine the CPU_PER_SESSION, LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION, CONNECT_TIME, and PRIVATE_SGA to create a COMPOSITE LIMIT.

Call-level limits are enforced during the execution of each SQL statement.  When a call-level limit is exceeded, the last SQL command issued is rolled back.  All the previous statements issued are still valid, and the user can continue to execute other SQL statements.  The following system resources can be regulated at the call level:

* CPU_PER_CALL for the CPU time for the SQL statement
* LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL for the number of data blocks read for the SQL statement

The assignment of a cost to a resource can be performed with the ALTER RESOURCE COST command. Resource limits that you set explicitly for a user take precedence over the resource costs in an assigned profile.  The command line syntax for this command is:

&gt;-ALTER RESOURCE COST ---------------------------------------------------;--&gt;
                      |-[CPU_PER_SESSION n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]-----------|
                      |-[CONNECT_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]--------------|
                      |-[LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]-|
                      |-[PRIVATE_SGA  n [K|M]|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]--------|

For example,
ALTER RESOURCE COST CONNECT_TIME 100;

Use of resource limits is set in the database initialization parameter RESOURCE_LIMIT=TRUE.  By default this parameter is set to false.  This parameter can be changed interactively with an ALTER SYSTEM command.

The DBA_PROFILES view provides information on all the profiles and the resource limits for each profile.  The RESOURCE_COST view shows the unit cost associated with each resource. Each user can find information on his resources and limits in the USER_RESOURCE_LIMITS view. 

Below is a description of these data dictionary views.

QoS Management Support for Oracle RAC Enterprise Edition
 
Oracle Database Quality of Service (QoS) Management allows system administrators to directly measure application service levels hosted on Oracle RAC Enterprise Edition databases. Using a policy-based architecture, QoS Management correlates accurate run-time performance and resource metrics based on user-defined workload classes. QoS Management then presents them in an integrated Enterprise Manager dashboard to review real-time performance of consolidated applications.  In conjunction with Cluster Health Monitor (CHM), QoS Management's memory guard detects nodes that are at risk of failure due to the overcommitment of memory. QoS Management responds by automatically preventing new connections thus preserving existing workloads, and restores connectivity once sufficient memory is available again.
 
Enable Oracle QoS Management at the Database Level
1. Log in to Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control as the database administrator. If not selected, click the Database tab.

2. Go to the Availability page.

3. Under the heading Services, select Enable/Disable Quality Of Service Management. Enter the Cluster and Database credentials, then click Login.

The Enable/Disable QoS Management screen is displayed.

4. You are prompted to enter a password for the APPQOSSYS user. Choose a password and enter it in the Password and Confirm Password fields, click OK.
     When you provide a password, the following actions take place:
     The APPQOSSYS account, which enables the Oracle Database QoS Management server to connect to the database, is unlocked and the new password is set.

     The credentials are written to an Oracle Wallet stored in the Oracle Cluster Repository to enable Oracle Database QoS Management to log in to the database.

  APPQOS_PLAN is set as the active Oracle Database Resource Manager plan so that Oracle Database QoS Management can adjust CPU access for Performance
     Classes.  By default, the APPQOS_PLAN is replaced during the Oracle Scheduler maintenance window. Oracle recommends that you use the APPQOS_PLAN as the plan during those daily windows because this plan incorporates the consumer groups from the DEFAULT_MAINTENANCE_PLAN plan.</fixtext><fix id="F-57041r1_fix" /><check system="C-54281r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review DBMS settings and documentation to determine if the DBMS restricts resource usage by priority.

This capability is available in Oracle at both the user and database level.  

At the user level, we create resource profiles for users of the database. 

Resource Parameters
SESSIONS_PER_USER            Specify the number of concurrent sessions to which you want to limit the user.
CPU_PER_SESSION              Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.
CPU_PER_CALL                 Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.
CONNECT_TIME                 Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.
IDLE_TIME                    Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION    Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.
LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL       Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).
PRIVATE_SGA                  Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). 
COMPOSITE_LIMIT              Specify the total resource cost for a session, expressed in service units. 

To check the resource controls assigned to a user query the DBA_PROFILES and DBA_USERS tables in the following manner.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba
SQL&gt; select a.username, 
            a.profile, 
   b.resource_name, 
   b.limit
     from   dba_users a, 
         dba_profiles b
     where  b.resource_type is not null
     and a.profile = b.profile;

The output should look like the output below and display the users and the contents of their profiles.

USERNAME        PROFILE       RESOURCE NAME      LIMIT
--------        -------       -------------      -----
SCOTT           DEFAULT       SESSIONS_PER_USER  UNLIMITED
SCOTT           DEFAULT       CPU_PER_SESSION    UNLIMITED


At the Oracle Database layer, the QoS Management helps manage the resources that are shared by applications in a cluster. Oracle Database QoS Management can help identify and resolve performance bottlenecks. Oracle Database QoS Management does not diagnose or tune application or database performance issues. When tuning the performance of your applications, the goal is to achieve optimal performance. Oracle Database QoS Management does not seek to make your applications run faster, but instead works to remove obstacles that prevent your applications from running at their optimal performance levels.

Use the console to see if you can access the Oracle Database QoS Management Dashboard
To access the Dashboard, perform the following steps:
1. Log in to Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control as the CRS Administrator user. Click the Cluster tab, if not selected.
2. Go to the Administration page, then click the Dashboard link under the heading Quality of Service Management to open the login screen for Oracle Database QoS Management.
3. A login screen appears, prompting you for the Oracle Database QoS Management administrator (QoSAdmin) credentials. After typing in the username and password, click Login.
4. The Quality of Service Management Dashboard page is displayed after the correct credentials are entered.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-52227"><title>SRG-APP-000271-DB-000156</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-66443r1_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>O112-C3-020200</version><title>The DBMS must support organizational requirements to employ automated patch management tools to facilitate flaw remediation to organization-defined information system components.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The organization (including any contractor to the organization) shall promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes).

Notes on Oracle Backup and Recovery Solutions

When implementing a backup and recovery strategy, you have the following solutions available:

--  Recovery Manager (RMAN)
Recovery Manager is fully integrated with the Oracle database to perform a range of backup and recovery activities, including maintaining an RMAN repository of historical data about backups. You can access RMAN through the command line or through Oracle Enterprise Manager.
   
--  User-managed backup and recovery
In this solution, you perform backup and recovery with a mixture of host operating system commands and SQL*Plus recovery commands. You are responsible for determining all aspects of when and how backups and recovery are done.

--  Media management
If you do not want to use RMAN with an encrypted backup, consider configuring RMAN to make backups to a media manager.  On most platforms, to back up to and restore from sequential media such as tape, you
must integrate a media manager with your Oracle database. You can use Oracle Secure Backup, which supports both database and file system backups to tape, as your media manager. See Oracle Secure Backup Administrator's Guide to learn how to set up RMAN for use specifically with Oracle Secure Backup.

These solutions are supported by Oracle and are fully documented, but RMAN is the preferred solution for database backup and recovery. RMAN provides a common interface for backup tasks across different host operating systems, and offers several backup techniques not available through user-managed methods.  

--  Incremental backups:
An incremental backup stores only blocks changed since a previous backup.  Thus, they provide more compact backups and faster recovery, thereby reducing the need to apply redo during data file media recovery. If you enable block change tracking, then you can improve performance by avoiding full scans of every input data file. You use the BACKUP INCREMENTAL command to perform incremental backups.
   
--  Block media recovery
You can repair a data file with only a small number of corrupt data blocks without taking it offline or restoring it from backup. You use the RECOVER BLOCK command to perform block media recovery.

--  Binary compression
A binary compression mechanism integrated into Oracle Database reduces the size of backups.

--  Encrypted backups
--  RMAN uses backup encryption capabilities integrated into Oracle Database to store backup sets in an encrypted format. To create encrypted backups on disk, the database must use the Advanced Security Option. To create encrypted backups directly on tape, RMAN must use the Oracle Secure Backup SBT interface but does not require the Advanced Security Option.

--  Automated database duplication
Easily creates a copy of your database, supporting various storage configurations, including direct duplication between ASM databases.

--  Cross-platform data conversion
Whether you use RMAN or user-managed methods, you can supplement physical backups with logical backups of schema objects made with Data Pump Export utility. You can later use Data Pump Import to re-create data after restore and recovery.  Logical backups are mostly beyond the scope of the backup and recovery documentation.</fixtext><fix id="F-57057r1_fix" /><check system="C-54297r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>Review DBMS recovery procedures and technical system features to determine if mechanisms exist and are in place to specify use of trusted files during DBMS recovery.

Database management systems and transaction-based processing systems are examples of information systems that are transaction-based. Transaction rollback and transaction journaling are examples of mechanisms supporting transaction recovery.  

The maintenance of data integrity involves preservation and control of not only the data contents, but the relationships between two or more related data items and the actions taken on one that may affect others. A DBMS provides data integrity that may be affected by incomplete or interrupted transactions by means of logging transaction events. This allows the database to recover data content to a point where the data content and its relationships are known to be intact. This data integrity is maintained when the data is undergoing a change or update event. Most DBMS's enable transaction rollback or recovery by default and as an automatic feature of database recovery.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000553</ident><fixtext fixref="F-57059r1_fix">Enable transaction journaling for the database.

The Oracle recommended process for backup and recovery is Oracle RMAN.  If Oracle RMAN is deployed, execute the following commands to ensure that the evidence of the implementation of the backup policy includes validating that the files are restorable:

Validating Database Files with BACKUP VALIDATE
 --You can use the BACKUP VALIDATE command to do the following:
    --     Check datafiles for physical and logical block corruption
    --     Confirm that all database files exist and are in the correct locations
 --When you run BACKUP VALIDATE, RMAN reads the files to be backed up in their entirety, as it would during a real backup. RMAN does not, however, actually produce any backup sets or image copies.
--You cannot use the BACKUPSET, MAXCORRUPT, or PROXY parameters with BACKUP VALIDATE. 
--To validate files with the BACKUP VALIDATE command:
     1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database and recovery catalog (if used).
     2. Run the BACKUP VALIDATE command.
        For example, you can validate that all database files and archived logs can be backed up by running a command as shown in the following example. This command checks for physical corruptions only.
        BACKUP VALIDATE
          DATABASE
          ARCHIVELOG ALL;
      To check for logical corruptions in addition to physical corruptions, run the  following variation of the preceding command:
        BACKUP VALIDATE
          CHECK LOGICAL
          DATABASE
          ARCHIVELOG ALL;
   In the preceding examples, the RMAN client displays the same output that it would if it were really backing up the files. If RMAN cannot back up one or more of the files, then it issues an error message. 
Validating Backups Before Restoring Them
   
   You can run RESTORE ... VALIDATE to test whether RMAN can restore a specific file or set of files from a backup. RMAN chooses which backups to use. The database must be mounted or open for this command. You do not have to take datafiles offline when validating the restore of datafiles, because validation of backups of the datafiles only reads the backups and does not affect the production datafiles. When validating files on disk or tape, RMAN reads all blocks in the backup piece or image copy. RMAN also validates offsite backups. The validation is identical to a real restore operation except that RMAN does not write output files.
   
   To validate backups with the RESTORE command:
     1. Run the RESTORE command with the VALIDATE option.
        This following example illustrates validating the restore of the database and all archived redo logs:
        RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE;
          RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL VALIDATE;

  If you do not see an RMAN error stack, then skip the subsequent steps. The lack of error messages means that RMAN had confirmed that it can use these backups successfully during a real restore and recovery.

 2. If you see error messages in the output and the RMAN-06026 message, then investigate the cause of the problem. If possible, correct the problem that is preventing RMAN from validating the backups and retry the validation. The following error means that RMAN cannot restore one or more of the specified files from your available backups:

    RMAN-06026: some targets not found - aborting restore
       The following sample output shows that RMAN encountered a problem reading the specified backup:
       RMAN-03009: failure of restore command on c1 channel at 12-DEC-06 23:22:30
       ORA-19505: failed to identify file "oracle/dbs/1fafv9gl_1_1"

   Authentication is used to prove the identity of the user. Authenticating user identity is imperative in distributed environments, without which there can be little confidence in network security. Passwords are the most common means of authentication. Oracle Advanced Security enables strong multifactor authentication with Oracle authentication adapters that support various third-party authentication services, including SSL with digital certificates as well as Smart Cards (CAC, PIV).
   
   Oracle Advanced Security provides multifactor authentication to the database.  With Oracle Advanced Security, customers can require their users to plug-in a Smart Card (CAC, PIV) as part of their SSL-based authentication to the Oracle Database.

A group authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a group authenticator is the UNIX OS 'root' user account, a Windows 'administrator' account, an 'SA' account, or a 'helpdesk' account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.

Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a group authenticator, this requirement will apply.

There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.

When group accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000770</ident><fixtext fixref="F-57079r1_fix">Configure DBMS, OS and/or enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism to require individual authentication prior to authentication for group account access.

(Oracle Access Manager may be helpful in meeting this requirement. Notes on Oracle Access Manager follow.)

Oracle Access Manager is used when there is a need for multifactor authentication of applications front-ending Oracle Datasets that may use group accounts. Oracle Access Manager supports using PKI-based smart cards (CAC, PIV) for multifactor authentication. When a user authenticates to a smart card application, the smart card engine produces a certificate-based authentication token. You can configure a certificate-based authentication scheme in Oracle Access Manager that uses information from the smart card certificate. Certificate-based authentication works with any smart card or similar device that presents an X.509 certificate.

Check:

First, check that the Authentication Module is set up properly:
1)  Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.  Select the X509Scheme.
2)  Make sure the Authentication Module option is set to X509Plugin.

Second, check your Authentication policy is using the x509Scheme:
1)  Go to Oracle Access Manager Home Screen and click the Policy Configuration tab.
2)  Select Application Domains.  Select Search.
3)  Select the application domain protecting the Oracle Database.
4)  Select the Authentication Polices tab and Click Protected Resource Policy.
5)  Make sure the Authentication Scheme is set to x509Scheme.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-52265"><title>SRG-APP-000156-DB-000111</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-66481r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O112-C2-013600</version><title>The DBMS must use organization-defined replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged accounts.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.

Data modification attack 
   
   An unauthorized party intercepting data in transit, altering it, and retransmitting it is a data modification attack. For example, intercepting a $100 bank deposit, changing the amount to $10,000,  and retransmitting the higher amount is a data modification attack.
   
Replay attack
   
   Repetitively retransmitting an entire set of valid data is a replay attack, such as intercepting a $100 bank withdrawal and retransmitting it ten times, thereby receiving $1,000. With Oracle Advanced Security we use Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).

Cipher Block Chaining
   
   Is an encryption method that protects against block replay attacks by making the encryption of a cipher block dependent on all blocks that precede it; it is designed to make unauthorized decryption incrementally more difficult. Oracle Advanced Security employs outer cipher block chaining because it is more secure than inner cipher block chaining, with no material performance penalty.

For accounts managed by Oracle, determine if it is practical and acceptable to require a password change every 35 days or fewer, rather than the standard 60 days (as specified in SRG-APP-000174-DB-000080).  If it is, issue the statement:
ALTER PROFILE PPPPPP LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 35;
(See the Oracle-provided $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/secconf.sql script for examples.)

If password changes every 35 days or fewer are unacceptable or impractical, implement an alternative method, such as a stored procedure run daily, to disable accounts inactive for more than 35 days.

The following are notes on a method suggested by Oracle.

Check either the login_audit_info_all or the dba_audit_session to see what users have not logged in for the site-defined number of days.  

If the login_audit_info_all exists, execute the following query to get a report of the users who have exceeded the site-specific guidelines and lock those accounts.  

Generate a report to see what users have not logged in in the last 30 days or whatever the site-specified expiration days requirement is.

sqlplus connect as sysdba - If sys.login_audit_info_all exists and contains rows, use the following query to see if there are any users who have not logged in for a period of time that is defined as the amount of time required to generate a locked account.

For accounts managed by Oracle, check DBMS settings to determine if accounts can be automatically disabled by the system after 35 days of inactivity. Also, ask the DBA if an alternative method, such as a stored procedure run daily, to disable Oracle-managed accounts inactive for more than 35 days, has been deployed.  

If the ability to disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity, by either of these means, does not exist, this is a finding.

Check to see what profile a user is associated with, if any, with this query:
          SQL&gt; select username, profile 
          from dba_users 
          where username = '&amp;Enter_Username';

Then check the profile to see what the password_life_time is set to in the table dba_profiles;  The password_life_time is a value stored in the column named resource_name.

SQL&gt;select profile, resource_name, resource_type, limit from dba_profiles where upper(resource_name) = 'PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME';

The following are notes on a method suggested by Oracle.

In SRG-APP-000075-DB-000029 - The DBMS must, upon successful login, display to the user the date and time of the user's last login advocated using a custom trigger for this event. One could query the audit table and get similar results, but that is a much busier table with a lot more data.  In SRG-APP-000075-DB-000029, we advocated to use a new table called sys.login_audit_info_all and trap login information with a login trigger.

Check for the existence of the  sys.login_audit_info_all and count the number of rows to ensure that the table is being used.  Obviously, the table will have maintenance performed on it to shrink the contents, so the number of rows may vary.  If the table itself exists, it is a good indication it is being used.  Connect to the database, check for the existence of the table, and count the rows, as this will help us understand if the fix for SRG-APP-000075-DB-000029 was implemented and will help us remediate this issue.

$ sqlplus connect as sysdba
SQL&gt; select count(*) from SYS.LOGIN_AUDIT_INFO_ALL;

If the count is greater than zero, then the table exists and data is being inserted.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-52271"><title>SRG-APP-000164-DB-000082</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-66487r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O112-C2-013900</version><title>The DBMS must support organizational requirements to enforce minimum password length.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

Weak passwords are a primary target for attack to gain unauthorized access to databases and other systems.

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store

To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential
  For example:
  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database.

For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

    1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:
        mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create
    For example:
        mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -create
        Enter password: password

The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. 
 
The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.
 
 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:
        mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
        Enter password: password
    For example:
        mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
        Enter password: password
In this specification the wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.  The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.  The username is the database login credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.
 
 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1.  For example, if you created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:
    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
           )
          )
 
 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:
        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.
 
If an application uses SSL for encryption, then the sqlnet.ora parameter, SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES, specifies SSL, and an SSL wallet is created. If this application wants to use secret store credentials to authenticate to databases (instead of the SSL certificate), then those credentials must be stored in the SSL wallet. After SSL authentication, if SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE, then the user names and passwords from the wallet are used to authenticate to databases. If SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = FALSE, then the SSL certificate is used.

Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.
        WALLET_LOCATION =
            (SOURCE =
              (METHOD = FILE)
              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
              )
             )
        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
        SSL_VERSION = 0</fixtext><fix id="F-57101r1_fix" /><check system="C-54341r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>(Oracle stores and displays its passwords in encrypted form.  Nevertheless, this should be verified by reviewing the relevant system views, along with the other items to be checked here.)

Ask the DBA to review the list of DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within and external to the DBMS that access the database. The list should also include files, tables or settings used to configure the operational environment for the DBMS and for interactive DBMS user accounts.

Ask the DBA and/or IAO to determine if any DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within or external to the DBMS that access the database, and DBMS/user environment files/settings/tables, contain database passwords. If any do, confirm that DBMS passwords stored internally or externally to the DBMS are encoded or encrypted. If any passwords are stored in clear text, this is a finding.

Ask the DBA/SA/Application Support staff if they have created an external password store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use.  Verify that all passwords stored there are encrypted.  If a password store is used and any password is not encrypted, this is a finding.

The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.

You can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials.

This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts  no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change.
  
The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials.
  
How Does the External Password Store Work?

Typically, users (and applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password.

For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias you entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string.
  
The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store:

  CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@orasales
  Enter password: password

  CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17
  Enter password: password

In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. You could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string.

However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database login credentials:

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA

  CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER
  
In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; you cannot create one connection string for multiple users.

In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologin feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-52287"><title>SRG-APP-000174-DB-000077</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-66503r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O112-C2-014900</version><title>Procedures for establishing temporary passwords that meet DoD password requirements for new accounts must be defined, documented, and implemented.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Password maximum lifetime is  the maximum period of time, (typically in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change it.

Passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals as per policy. Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked.

One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the system and/or application passwords could be compromised.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be for example a Certification Authority (CA).

Oracle Advanced Security (ASO) Data Integrity:

Oracle Advanced Security supports PKI-based authentication by using digital certificates over SSL in addition to the native encryption and data integrity capabilities of these protocols.

Oracle provides a complete PKI that is based on RSA Security, Inc., Public-Key Cryptography Standards, and which interoperates with Oracle servers and clients.  Oracle Advanced Security uses a wallet which is a container that is used to store authentication and signing credentials, including private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates needed by SSL. In an Oracle environment, every entity that communicates over SSL must have a wallet containing an X.509 version 3 certificate, private key, and list of trusted certificates.  Security administrators use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage security credentials on the server.

Unix and Windows platforms can be checked by selecting installed products in the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI).

Oracle Advanced Security supports authentication by using digital certificates over SSL in addition to the native encryption and data integrity capabilities of these protocols.

An Oracle Wallet is a container that is used to store authentication and signing credentials, including private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates needed by SSL. In an Oracle environment, every entity that communicates over SSL must have a wallet containing an X.509 version 3 certificate, private key, and list of trusted certificates, with the exception of Diffie-Hellman.

Security administrators use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage security credentials on the server. Wallet owners use it to manage security credentials on clients. Specifically, you use Oracle Wallet Manager to do the following:

Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.  

Remote network access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols and establishing a remote connection.  These connections will typically occur over either the internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).  Since neither of these internetworking mechanisms are private nor secure, if cryptography is not used, then the session data traversing the remote connection could be intercepted and compromised.  Cryptography provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection, thereby providing a degree of confidentiality. The encryption strength of the mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information traversing the remote connection.

From this listing, RC4, AES, and DES families are symmetric key algorithms, and also named ciphers. A symmetric key cipher will use the same key for both encryption and decryption. RC4 ciphers are stream-based ciphers; AES and DES are block-based ciphers.

Stream ciphers encrypt every bit individually by adding a key stream bit to a plain text bit. Depending on implementation there could be synchronous stream ciphers (the key stream depends only on the key) and asynchronous stream ciphers (the key stream also depends on the ciphertext). These types of ciphers have the advantage of being very fast compared to block ciphers but are more vulnerable to attacks. RC4 has a demonstrated weakness related to key setup, hence you should use the high key length variant (RC4 256) whenever possible. The stream ciphers provided by Oracle OAS are RC4 40, RC4 56, RC4 128, and RC4 256 bits, where 40, 56, 128, and 256 represent the key length.

Block-based ciphers encrypt an entire block of bits at a time using the same key. This means that every bit from a block depends on every bit on the same block.

AES is the abbreviation for Advanced Encryption Standard, and should be favored based on its solidity and good performance. It is a derivation of the Rijndael cipher where the block size is restricted to 128 bits. It was designed to replace the DES algorithm.

DES is the abbreviation for Data Encryption Standard. The original DES, based on the 56 bit key, is rarely used nowadays and is considered insecure. 3DES112 is a variant of 3DES, also called Triple DES, with two keys derived from the fact that it is using two keys, each being 56 bits in size or two phases of encryption.

3DES168 is a variant of 3DES using three 56 bits key or phases for encryption. It is strong but slow in software-based implementations.

Based on the fact that symmetric encryption is used, there must be a mechanism that allows exchanging the encryption keys between the parties involved in communication. The key exchange phase uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange the two parties have to agree on a random generated number known only to them. Based on this random number, after a series of transformations, an encryption key is generated (for RSA Laboratories - 3.6.1 What is Diffie-Hellman? go to http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2248) and used for data encryption. The encryption seed is used and strongly correlated with the generation of the random numbers. OAS network encryption uses CBC as the cipher mode of operation. 

For the desired encryption behavior you can specify four parameters, both on the server and on client side: REJECTED, ACCEPTED, REQUESTED, and REQUIRED.

The following table summarizes the combinations of parameters for desired behavior on client and server:

        Desired behavior - Client  Desired behavior - Server      Encryption

Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.  

Remote network access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols and establishing a remote connection. These connections will typically occur over the public Internet, the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or sometimes both. Since neither of these internetworking mechanisms are private nor secure, if cryptography is not used, then the session data traversing the remote connection could be intercepted and potentially modified. Cryptography provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized changes to the data traversing the remote access connection, thereby providing a degree of integrity. The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information that is traversing the remote connection.

Databases that accept remote connections must use approved cryptography to protect data being passed via a non-secure network. If approved cryptography is not used, data can be intercepted and potentially modified.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001453</ident><fixtext fixref="F-57161r4_fix">If the database accepts remote connections, but is not using approved cryptography, modify SQLNET.ORA to enable encryption, using an approved algorithm.

The strength requirements are dependent upon data classification.  

For unclassified data, where cryptography is required:
AES 128 for encryption
SHA 256 for hashing  

NSA has established the suite B encryption requirements for protecting National Security Systems (NSS) as follows.
AES 128 for Secret
AES 256 for Top Secret
SHA 256 for Secret  
SHA 384 for Top Secret

National Security System is defined as:
(OMB Circular A-130) Any telecommunications or information system operated by the United States Government, the function, operation, or use of which (1) involves intelligence activities; (2) involves cryptologic activities related to national security; (3) involves command and control of military forces; (4) involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or (5) is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions, but excluding any system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).

From this listing, RC4, AES, and DES families are symmetric key algorithms, and also named ciphers. A symmetric key cipher will use the same key for both encryption and decryption. RC4 ciphers are stream-based ciphers, AES and DES are block-based ciphers.

Stream ciphers encrypt every bit individually by adding a key stream bit to a plain text bit. Depending on implementation, there could be synchronous stream ciphers (the key stream depends only on the key) and asynchronous stream ciphers (the key stream also depends on the ciphertext). These types of ciphers have the advantage of being very fast compared to block ciphers but are more vulnerable to attacks. RC4 has a demonstrated weakness related to key setup, hence you should use the high key length variant (RC4 256) whenever possible. The stream ciphers provided by Oracle OAS are RC4 40, RC4 56, RC4 128, and RC4 256 bits, where 40, 56, 128, and 256 represent the key length.

Block-based ciphers encrypt an entire block of bits at a time using the same key. This means that every bit from a block depends on every bit on the same block.

AES is the abbreviation for Advanced Encryption Standard , and should be favored based on its solidity and good performance. It is a derivation of the Rijndael cipher where the block size is restricted to 128 bits. It was designed to replace the DES algorithm.

DES is the abbreviation for Data Encryption Standard. The original DES, based on the 56 bit key, is rarely used nowadays and is considered insecure. 3DES112 is a variant of 3DES, also called Triple DES, with two keys derived from the fact that it is using two keys, each being 56 bits in size or two phases of encryption.

3DES168 is a variant of 3DES using three 56 bits key or phases for encryption. It is strong but slow in software-based implementations.

Based on the fact that symmetric encryption is used, there must be a mechanism that allows exchanging the encryption keys between the parties involved in communication. The key exchange phase uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange the two parties have to agree on a random generated number known only to them. Based on this random number, after a series of transformations an encryption key is generated (for RSA Laboratories - 3.6.1 What is Diffie-Hellman? go to http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2248) and used for data encryption. The encryption seed is used and strongly correlated with the generation of the random numbers. OAS network encryption uses CBC as the cipher mode of operation. 

For the desired encryption behavior you can specify four parameters both on the server and on client side: REJECTED, ACCEPTED, REQUESTED, and REQUIRED.

The following table summarizes the combinations of parameters for desired behavior on client and server:

        Desired behavior - Client  Desired behavior - Server      Encryption

Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these internetworking mechanisms is private or secure and they do not by default restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established.
  
Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations after a security incident.
  
When organizations define security-related application functions or security-related application information, it is incumbent upon the application providing access to that data to ensure auditing of remote connectivity to those resources occurs in support of organizational requirements.
 
Remote access to security functions (e.g., user management, audit log management, etc.) and security-relevant information requires the activity be audited by the organization. Any application providing remote access must support organizational requirements to audit access or organization-defined security functions and security-relevant information.

About the Default Auditing Settings

When you use Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA) to create a new database, Oracle Database configures the database to audit the most commonly used security-relevant SQL statements and privileges. It also sets the AUDIT_TRAIL initialization parameter to DB EXTENDED. If you decide to use a different audit trail type (for example, OS if you want to write the audit trail records to operating system files), then you can do that, and Oracle Database continues to audit the privileges that are audited by default. If you disable auditing by setting the AUDIT_TRAIL parameter to NONE, then no auditing takes place.  The reason we really need to use DB EXTENDED is because that will write audit records directly to a table.

Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization  controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.  

Some networking protocols allowing remote access may not meet security requirements to protect data and components. Bluetooth and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure networking protocols.  

The DoD Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) program provides implementation guidance on the use of IP protocols and application and data services traversing the DoD Networks in a manner supporting net-centric operations.  

Applications implementing or utilizing remote access network protocols need to ensure the application is developed and implemented in accordance with the PPSM requirements. In situations where it has been determined that specific operational requirements outweigh the risks of enabling an insecure network protocol, the organization may pursue a risk acceptance.

Using protocols deemed non-secure would compromise the ability of the DBMS to operate in a secure fashion. The database must be able to disable network protocols deemed non-secure.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001436</ident><fixtext fixref="F-57165r1_fix">Disable any network protocol listed as non-secure in the PPSM documentation.

To disable the protocol deemed not secure, stop the listener by issuing the following command as the Oracle Software owner, typically Oracle.
          $ lsnrctl stop
This will stop the listener.  Edit the LISTENER.ORA file and remove the protocols deemed not secure and restart the listener.  

For example, if TCP was deemed as not secure and the listener.ora would need to be changed and the tcp entry would need to be removed.  That would only allow the listener to listen for an IPC connection.   

LISTENER=
  (DESCRIPTION=
    (ADDRESS_LIST=

Revise the client side TNSNAMES.ORA to align the PROTOCOL value in the PROTOCOL portion of the connect string.  For example, if TCP was deemed as not secure and the listener.ora was changed to listen for an IPC connection the code below would be required:

net_service_name=

(For definitive information on Ports, Protocols and Services Management (PPSM), refer to http://iase.disa.mil/ppsm/index.html.)

Review DBMS settings to determine if the database is utilizing any network protocols deemed non-secure.  If the DBMS is not using any network protocols deemed non-secure, this is not a finding..

If the database is utilizing protocols specified as non-secure in the PPSM, verify the protocols are explicitly identified in the System Security Plan and that they are in support of specific operational requirements. If they are not identified in the SSP or are not supporting specific operational requirements, this is a finding. 

If non-secure network protocols are not being used but are not disabled in the DBMS's configuration, this is a finding.

After determining the site-specific operational requirements and which protocols are explicitly defined in the System Security Plan, check the $TNS_ADMIN setting for the location of the Oracle listener.ora file.  The listener.ora file is a configuration file for Oracle Net Listener that identifies the following:
  A unique name for the listener, typically LISTENER
  A protocol address that it is accepting connection requests on, and 
  A service it is listening for.
  
If the listener.ora file shows a PROTOCOL= statement and the PROTOCOL is deemed non-secure, that is a finding.

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers.

Enterprise environments make application user account management challenging and complex.  A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.

Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.

Databases can have large numbers of users in disparate locations and job functions.  Automatic account management can help mitigate the risk of human error found in manually managing database access.

Utilize a DBMS (Oracle), OS, or third-party product that can automate some or all account maintenance functionality.

Roles and Profiles are two Oracle features that should be employed in account management.  (Indeed, other requirements mandate the use of Roles.)  Following are some notes from Oracle on the use of Profiles.

A profile is a named set of resource limits and password parameters that restrict database usage and instance resources for a user. You can assign a profile to each user, and a default profile to all others. Each user can have only one profile, and creating a new one supersedes any earlier one.

Profile resource limits are enforced only when you enable resource limitation for the associated database. Enabling such limitation can occur either before starting up the database (the RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter) or while it is open (using an ALTER SYSTEM statement).

While password parameters reside in profiles, they are unaffected by RESOURCE_LIMIT or ALTER SYSTEM and password management is always enabled. In Oracle Database 10g Release 2 (10.2), resource allocations and restrictions are primarily handled through the Database Resource Manager.</fixtext><fix id="F-57167r1_fix" /><check system="C-54389r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>If all user accounts are authenticated by the OS or an enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism, and not by Oracle, stop here:  this is not a finding against the DBMS.

Resource Parameters:

SESSIONS_PER_USER Specify the number of concurrent sessions to which you want to limit the user.

CPU_PER_SESSION  Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CPU_PER_CALL  Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CONNECT_TIME Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.

IDLE_TIME Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).

PRIVATE_SGA Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.

Password Parameters

Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes you can specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS  Specify the number of failed attempts to log in to the user account before the account is locked.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME  Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If you also set a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If you omit this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX  These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, you must specify an integer for both of them.

    If you specify an integer for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

    For example, if you specify PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

    If you specify an integer for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

    If you specify DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If you have not changed the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.

    If you set both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if you omit both parameters.

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME  Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed login attempts. If you omit this clause, then the default is 1 day.

PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME  Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and login is allowed. If you omit this clause, then the default is 7 days.

PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION  The PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION clause lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but you can create your own routine or use third-party software instead.</fixtext><fix id="F-57169r4_fix" /><check system="C-54391r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Oracle_Database_11.2g_STIG.xml" /><check-content>If all user accounts are authenticated by the OS or an enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism, and not by Oracle, stop here:  this is not a finding against the DBMS.

Active users take notice of system and data conditions and are usually the first to notify systems administrators when they notice a system or application-related anomaly pertaining to their own account.

The following are notes on a method suggested by Oracle.

In SRG-APP-000075-DB-000029 - The DBMS must, upon successful login, display to the user the date and time of the user's last login advocated using a custom trigger for this event. One could query the audit table and get similar results, but that is a much busier table with a lot more data.  In SRG-APP-000075-DB-000029, we advocated to use a new table called sys.login_audit_info_all and trap login information with a login trigger.

Check for the existence of the  sys.login_audit_info_all and count the number of rows to ensure that the table is being used.  Obviously, the table will have maintenance performed on it to shrink the contents, so the number of rows may vary.  If the table itself exists, it is a good indication it is being used.  Connect to the database, check for the existence of the table, and count the rows, as this will help us understand if the fix for SRG-APP-000075-DB-000029 was implemented and will help us remediate this issue.

One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to simply create a new account. 

Auditing of account creation is one method and best practice for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail documents the creation of application user accounts and, as required, notifies administrators and/or application owners that they exist. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.  

Note that user authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.

One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to simply modify an existing account. 

Auditing of account modification is one method and best practice for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive application account management process ensures an audit trail automatically documents the modification of application user accounts and, as required, notifies administrators, application owners, and/or appropriate individuals. Applications must provide this capability directly, leveraging complementary technology providing this capability or a combination thereof.

Automated account auditing processes greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously modified and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.  

Note that user authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data thereby providing increased information security for the organization.  

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.  If the owner of an object or information does not have rights to exclude access to an object or information at a user level, users may gain access to objects and information they are not authorized to view/modify.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001362</ident><fixtext fixref="F-57185r1_fix">Modify DBMS settings to allow users to assign or revoke access rights to objects and information owned by the user.

This is done by the default installation.  The installation documentation recommends that a user account named ORACLE is created and is identified as the software owner.  

If you log into the system as the software owner, typically ORACLE, the $ORACLE_HOME environment variable will point to the Oracle software.  If you enter the following commands you can see if ORACLE is the software owner:

$ cd $ORACLE_HOME
$ ls -l (shows the directories - oracle is the owner and oinstall is the group)

Organizations also apply least privilege concepts to the design, development, implementation, and operations of information systems.

Privileges granted outside the role of the application user job function are more likely to go unmanaged or without oversight for authorization.

Consider wrapping the startup command with a shell or wrapper and using an Oracle external password store.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility.  Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.

Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle3 External Password Store.

  To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store.  To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:

  $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential

  For example:

  $ mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -listCredential

  The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.

Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store

  If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database.

  For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.

  If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:

    1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:
 
 mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -create
    Enter password: password

    The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. 
 
 The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.
 
 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:

    mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username
    Enter password: password

    For example:

    mkstore -wrl c:\oracle\product\11.2.0\db_1\wallets -createCredential oracle system
    Enter password: password

    In this specification:

    The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet.  The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.
 
 The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME\network\admin on Windows.
 
 The username is the database login credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.
 
 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1.  For example, if you created the wallet in 
       $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file:
    
    WALLET_LOCATION =
           (SOURCE =
             (METHOD = FILE)
             (METHOD_DATA =
           (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
           )
          )
 
 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:

       SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE

       This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.

       When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.
 
    If an application uses SSL for encryption, then the sqlnet.ora parameter, SQLNET.AUTHENTICATION_SERVICES, specifies SSL and an SSL wallet is created. If this application wants to use secret store credentials to authenticate to databases (instead of the SSL certificate), then those credentials must be stored in the SSL wallet. After SSL authentication, if SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE, then the user names and passwords from the wallet are used to authenticate to databases. If SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = FALSE, then the SSL certificate is used.
 
    Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.

        Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters Set

        WALLET_LOCATION =

              (METHOD_DATA =
            (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin)
              )
             )

        SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
        SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE

"If default account names are not changed, an attacker has a predefined list of accounts to target.  Since most default accounts are administrative in nature, the compromise of a default account can have catastrophic consequences, including the complete loss of control over the information system."

However, Oracle does not provide for changing user names directly.  Workarounds to achieve the effect of a name change are cumbersome.

The inclusion of role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. 

To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, the application must support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to organization-defined lists of security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (non-security) system functions.

Use of privileged accounts for non-administrative purposes puts data at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure. In particular, DBA accounts if used for non-administration application development or application maintenance can lead to miss-assignment of privileges where privileges are inherited by object owners. It may also lead to loss or compromise of application data where the elevated privileges bypass controls designed in and provided by applications.

The DBMS software installation account may require privileges not required for database administration or other functions.

DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit, resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

The DBMS must ensure the recipient of permissions possesses only the access intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit rights propagation if that is the intent of the grantor.

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked).

Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for determining which application components shall provide auditable events.

Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the DBMS configuration or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Oracle Database 11.2g</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2669</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000172</ident><fixtext fixref="F-57285r1_fix">Configure the DBMS's auditing settings to include auditing of events on the DoD-selected list of auditable events.

The alias for the listener follows tnslsnr in the command output.

You must be logged on the host system using the account that owns the tnslsnr executable (UNIX).

C-Shell (CSH) = .cshrc
Bourne Shell (SH) = .profile
Korn Shell (KSH) = .kshrc

Log in using the Oracle software owner account and enter the command:

umask

If the value returned is 022 or more restrictive, this is not a Finding.

If the value returned is less restrictive than 022, this is a Finding.

The first number sets the mask for user/owner file permissions. The second number sets the mask for group file permissions. The third number sets file permission mask for other users. The list below shows the available settings:

0 = read/write/execute
1 = read/write
2 = read/execute
3 = read
4 = write/execute
5 = write
6 = execute
7 = no permissions

Setting the umask to 022 effectively sets files for user/owner to read/write, group to read and other to read. Directories are set for user/owner to read/write/execute, group to read/execute and other to read/execute.

For Windows Systems:
Review the permissions that control access to the Oracle installation software directories (e.g. \Program Files\Oracle\).

DBA accounts, the DBMS process account, the DBMS software installation/maintenance account, SA accounts if access by them is required for some operational level of support such as backups, and the host system itself require access.

Compare the access control employed with that documented in the System Security Plan.

If access controls do not match the documented requirement, this is a Finding.

(rule=(src=[IP]/27)(dst=[IP])(srv=*)(act=accept))

NOTE: an IP address with a "/" indicates acceptance by subnet mask where the number after the "/" is the left most number of bits in the address that must match for the rule to apply.

If this rule is database-specific, then determine if the SERVICE_NAME parameter is set:

From SQL*PLUS:

select value from v$parameter where name = 'service_names';

If SERVICE_NAME is set in the initialization file for the database instance, use (srv=[service name]), else, use (srv=*) if not set or rule applies to all databases on the DBMS server.

If network access restriction is performed by an external device, validate ACLs are in place to prohibit unauthorized access to the DBMS.  To do this, find the IP address of the database server (destination address) and source address (authorized IPs) in the System Security Plan.  Confirm only authorized IPs from the System Security Plan are allowed access to the DBMS.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-54049"><title>SRG-APP-000516-DB-999900</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-68289r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>O112-BP-025700</version><title>DBMS data files must be dedicated to support individual applications.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;DBMS data files may contain database objects supporting different applications.
