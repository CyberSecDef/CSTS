</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Requirement: The IAO will ensure that all modem phone lines are restricted and configured to their mission required purpose (inward dial only or outward dial only).

Ubiquitous phone lines open major security holes in a network.  The more tightly they can be controlled, the less the exposure to vulnerabilities.  Allowing special features to remain active on modem phone lines create advantageous situations for malicious attacks.  An attacker may use special features to forward modem or voice calls to destinations that cause toll-fraud, or forward the number to itself causing a denial of service.  Telephone lines that provide DSN modems dial tone will be provisioned only with their required functions. Some components of the DSN “dial back” option may require two modems for proper operation.  If a modem is dedicated to receive calls, it should be provisioned to not allow outbound calling.  If a modem is dedicated to place calls, it should be provisioned to not accept incoming calls.

Reasons include modem power failure, link disconnection, loss of carrier, etc. Serial ports that are interrupted due to link disconnection, power failure or other reasons will force out the user (i.e., end the session using the port). This will prevent a remote user from ending a session without logging off and leaving the remote maintenance port available with an active session that might allow unauthorized use by someone other than the authenticated user. This will also prevent the physical hijacking of an active session by unplugging the connected cable and plugging in another. 

NOTE: This requirement primarily addresses the use of EIA/RS-232 serial interfaces (serial craft or console ports) in conjunction with a modem. It requires the enablement of the hardware handshaking capabilities that are typically inherent in the interface and the associated Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART). The hardware handshaking capabilities can easily detect modem power failure, link disconnection, and loss of carrier. The software response to these hardware indicators is to terminate any active session such that re-authentication is required if the session is re-established. This capability also supports the prevention of physically hijacking the connection or session by unplugging the modem and plugging in a local workstation or other communications device. However, such physical hijacking is substantially mitigated by limiting physical access to the port connection to authorized personnel via physical access security methods. Unfortunately, some EIA/RS-232 port implementations in some vendor’s products do not include the physical handshaking lead connections needed to fulfill this requirement. In some cases only the three minimally required data leads (TX, RX, and GND) are implemented. In this case, Xon-Xoff flow control is used to synchronize communications as opposed to the hardware handshaking. Additional measures must be implemented in hardware or software to detect session interruption and effect its termination. This may require special serial communications software or middleware that implements a keep-alive signal. When the keep-alive signal is lost, the session is terminated. Other methods may be employed as well.

DOD Instruction 8100.3 which governs DOD telecommunications and the Defense Switched Network (DSN), requires that “Telecommunications switches (and associated software releases) leased, procured (whether systems or services), or operated by the DOD Components, and connected or planned for connection to the DSN, shall be joint interoperability certified by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) and granted information assurance certification and accreditation by the Defense Information System Network (DISN) Designated Approval Authorities (DAAs).” DAA certification is obtained through the DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG). DODI 8100.3 also requires that the DOD use (or connect to the DSN) only devices that appear on the DSN Approved Products List (APL). Both IA and Interoperability certification requirements must be met for inclusion on the DSN APL.

The testing for IA and IO that occurs prior to DSN APL listing determines if the system/device meets, or can be configured to meet DoD requirements. The IA testing determines any residual risk for operating the system. This risk is accepted by the DSAWG prior to APL listing.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;This finding can be reduced to a CAT IV if the system is in process of being certified for placement on the APL.&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;The possible inability to certify and accredit the system or operate it legally or connect it to another DoD system due to violation of DoD policy.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCAS-1, EBCR-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target DoD Telecom Site / System {All}</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>DoD Telecom Site / System {All}</dc:subject><dc:identifier>593</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-7997r1_fix">Ensure non-certified VoIP systems are not connected to the DSN.

(RE: Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/9 Annex G, Paragraphs 2.2.1, 2.2.1.1, 2.2.1.6, and Telecommunications Security Group (TSG) Standard 2)

All voice/video/RTS terminals or instruments present a potential risk to the security of areas where classified conversations are conducted. This is due to the ability of some phones to pick up room audio and transmitting it or sending it down the wire even when the phone is on hook. This ability is usually caused by poor design or malfunction in the hook switch circuitry. This is covered in TSG Standard 2. Additionally speakerphones in such areas may be activated by accident or surreptitiously. These vulnerabilities can affect the security or confidentiality of any conversation at any classification level. Of particular concern are those areas or rooms used for classified meetings, conversations, or work such as SCIFs. Additionally, VoIP systems in which the central call manager controls the telephone instrument, there is the potential of hijacking control of the instrument from somewhere else on the network. This potential vulnerability means that audio pickup might be activated clandestinely without the knowledge of the people near it.

Input screening in telecommunications switches is the feature that permits an authorized individual to use one or more command classes.  This feature supports DAC requirements and is used for both local and remote administration of the switches.                         

Most switches utilize user password protection to access the operation and configuration of the switch.  Most switch designs utilize levels of privileged access, each using password submission and validation at each level, to allow access to that particular function.  The lowest privilege level would allow user access to perform various routine maintenance tasks or entry of subscriber data.  A second level would give access to perform highly important routines, configuration changes, and change capability of first and second level passwords.  Changing a second level password often requires a distinct identification or special password.                          

Discretionary access control for system administration and maintenance access to the switch or peripheral system commands must be restricted based on the required functions or role of the user where technically feasible.                              

Input command screening can be implemented in switches to further control user access and privileges.  To do this, individual commands available in the switch are first assigned a specific command class.  Each Administrative/Maintenance user is then assigned a primary function that is associated with a collection of input commands that the system accepts from that specific user.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;This is not a finding if the system does not support command screening&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&gt; Denial of Service, degradation of service, loss of confidentiality, system compromise, and/or unauthorized access to network or system resources or services and the information they contain.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;System Administrator&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECLP-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target DoD Telecom Site / System {All}</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>DoD Telecom Site / System {All}</dc:subject><dc:identifier>593</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-7968r1_fix">Implement processes / procedures, generate documents, and/or adjust configuration(s) / architecture, as necessary to comply with policy.</fixtext><fix id="F-7968r1_fix" /><check system="C-7690r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="I" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Voice - DSN.xml" /><check-content>Interview the IAO and/or SA to confirm compliance through discussion, review of site policy and procedures, diagrams, documentation, configuration files, logs, records, DAA/other approvals, etc as applicable.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-8556"><title>SA and maintenance user accounts NOT documented</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-9053r1_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>DSN06.06</version><title>All system administrative and maintenance user accounts are not documented.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Requirement: The IAO will document all system administrative and maintenance user accounts.

The term strong two-factor authentication refers to the use of two forms of identification. This is usually something you know and something you have. A username and password is not considered two-factor authentication. It is actually the something you know. This could also be a security code. The something you have is a typically physical token. An example of this is a bankcard and PIN. Additionally there are tokens associated with one-time password access control systems available such as RSA Security’s SecurID and Quest Software’s NC-Pass. These provide a constantly changing code that is used in conjunction with an additional PIN or password to generate a one time password. The code is generated by a RNG algorithm that is synchronized with a server application (e.g., RSA ACE). These and similar tokens are, and have been, widely used in DoD for access control to network elements, servers, and mainframes.  These and similar one-time password tokens used in conjunction with their associated access control servers meet the intent of this requirement. 

NOTE: One-time password tokens and systems are older technology which is no longer mentioned in DoD policy even though the technology has been in previous DoD policy; has been in use for some time; and is currently being used in many instances for access control to legacy systems. Going forward, however, DoD policy only supports DoD’s token of choice which is the Common Access Card (CAC) or Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card which contain DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates. The CAC/PIV is the DoD’s token of choice. Meeting this requirement does not satisfy requirements that dictate the use of CAC/PKI tokens. The use of a one-time-password token and access control server can only (and may only) serve as a mitigation for not being able to meet CAC/PKI requirements. This is typical of older legacy systems such as mainframes. 

APL NOTE: New systems being developed for use by DoD and those being tested for inclusion on the DoD Approved Products List (APL) should support CAC/PKI tokens rather than one-time password token systems.

NOTE: The use of a token/system (RSA Security’s SecurID or similar) that provides a constantly changing code used in conjunction with a PIN or password to generate a one time password meets the intent of this requirement as does the use of CAC/PKI tokens . 

This is NOT a finding in the event either CAC/PKI tokens OR one-time password tokens are used for administrator authentication. 

NOTE: Meeting the intent of this requirement using a one-time password token system does not satisfy other CAC/PKI token requirements or requirements mandating their use. The use of a one-time password token system does however provide a mitigation for systems that cannot be CAC/PKI enabled.

The term remote authentication refers to a system or device that communicates with a remote Authentication Authorization Accounting (AAA) server to validate the users account information before granting access. The remote server can also control user rights or permissions based on their defined roles. Systems such as RADIUS, DIAMETER, and TACACS+ typically provide this functionality for network elements. Systems such as domain controllers provide this functionality for network management workstations.

The use of a centralized AAA server provides for centralized management of all network element SA’s accounts and privileges. This eliminates the need for an SA to have an individual account on each network element. This reduces the chance that an account will be compromised since the centralized server can be better protected than each network element. This also reduces the number of accounts in the network that can be easily accessed and compromised. A network consists of manu network elements that cannot be individually protected. An SA account on each multiplies the chance that an account can be compromised.  Additionally, the use of a centralized AAA server supports proper password management when a SA is required to manage multiple devices. If the SA had to change his/her password on each device, the chance that a password is not changed (device missed) is greater.

NOTE: This requirement supports, and is supported by, the Network Infrastructure STIG requirements that AAA servers are to be implemented in the enclave’s management network. In general the DSN system should integrate with the AAA service that already exists in the enclave’s management network if possible. 

This requirement is primarily focused on a group of distributed devices such as those that comprise a network (e.g., LAN switches, routers, backbone transport devices, distributed media gateways, endpoints, etc). While a system/device that is itself centralized (e.g., a telecom switch or VoIP controller); is capable of comprehensive role based AAA services such that it can stand on its own; which can protected from external access much as a centralized AAA server would be, It is still best practice to integrate such a device with a centralized AAA server particularly if multiple SAs must have access from multiple locations such as different local or remote NOCs.

This same sensitivity is included in VTUs that are used in office spaces. This has one disadvantage. The microphones can pick up sidebar conversations that have no relationship to the conference or call in progress. Likewise, in an open area, received conference audio can be broadcast to others in the area that are not part of the conference, and possibly should not be exposed to the conference information for need-to-know reasons. Speakerphones exhibit a similar vulnerability. This is the same confidentiality vulnerability posed to audible sound information in the environment as discussed above with the added twist that the conference audio is vulnerable to others in the environment. While this is more of an issue in environments where classified conversations normally occur, it is also an issue in any environment. This is of particularly concern in open work areas or open offices where multiple people work in near proximity. Users or operators of VTC systems of any type must take care regarding who can hear what is being said during a conference call and what unrelated conversations can be picked up by the sensitive microphone. Where a VTU is used by a single person in an open area, a partial mitigation for this could be the use of a headset with earphones and a microphone. While this would limit the ability of others to hear audio from the conference and could also limit the audio pickup of unrelated conversations, it may not be fully effective. In some instances, such as when a VTU is located in a SCIF, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) handset/headset may be required Microphones embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint, PC, or PC monitor can be sensitive enough to pick up sound that is not related to a given communications session. They could pick up nearby conversations and other sounds. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is not related to the communications in progress. Speakers embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint or PC can be made loud enough to be heard across a room or in the next workspace. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is being communicated during a session. Users must be aware of other conversations in the area and their sensitivity when using any communications endpoint, not only a PC based voice, video, or collaboration communications application. This awareness must then translate into protecting or eliminating these other conversations. A short range, reduced gain, or noise canceling microphone may be required. A push to talk microphone may also be required for classified areas. The microphone should be muted when the user is not speaking as both mitigation for this issue, and for proper etiquette when participating in a conference. The muting function should be performed using a positively controlled disconnect, shorting switch, or mechanism instead of a software controlled mute function on the PC. Users must be aware of other people in the area that could hear what is being communicated. This is particularly an issue if the communicated information is sensitive or classified since the parties overhearing the information may not have proper clearance or a need-to-know. To mitigate this issue, a headset or speakers should be used and at a volume that only the user can hear.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECND-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target DoD Telecom Site / System {All}</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>DoD Telecom Site / System {All}</dc:subject><dc:identifier>593</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-16180r2_fix">Ensure a policy and procedure is in place and enforced that addresses the placement and operation of hardware based voice and video communications devices and PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications with regard to their audio pickup and broadcast capabilities in relation to the sensitivity of the information communicated.
