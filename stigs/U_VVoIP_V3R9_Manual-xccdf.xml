For DoD, this presents two issues or vulnerabilities. Access to voicemail from a telephone only requires the user’s telephone number and a PIN. The telephone number is the account or mailbox number on the voicemail system while the PIN is the user password for accessing the account. This is a rather weak authentication method. The first issue for DoD, is that DoD policy states that access to email requires PKI based authentication of the user before they are granted access to their email account. PKI certificates are required to decrypt encrypted email. PKI authentication is not available when using a standard telephone. While some organizations might implement PKI authenticated access to the site’s phone system, such a facility is not available via most DoD phone systems and certainly not via the PSTN. Additionally, while a non-PKI enabled text-to-speech feature would not be able to read encrypted email (which would be considered the most sensitive) the unencrypted email is still considered sensitive DoD information. The argument could be made that normal voicemail messages and regular telephone conversations can also contain sensitive information. However, there is typically more sensitive information in email. This does not apply to DoD issued PDA/PED devices that provide CAC authenticated access to email. Access to unified mail voicemail would be via PKI authenticated email service through which the user could listen to the voicemail. Text-to-speech conversion would be permitted in this case even though caution should be used when listening to any voicemail, particularly in a public place. The use of a wired earphone is highly recommended. The use of Bluetooth, DECT/DECT 6.0, and other RF wireless technologies for accessories must be approved.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Voice Mail</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Voice Mail</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1773</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20189r2_fix">In the event an email text-to-speech feature is employed or enabled in a unified messaging system, and accessed via the dial-in voicemail access method, ensure PKI based authentication is used to access the feature as is required for normal email access control.

In the event an email text-to-speech feature is employed or enabled in a unified messaging and email system, and accessed via the dial-in voicemail access method, ensure DoD PKI authentication is used to access the feature as is required for normal email access control. Otherwise, disable the text-to-speech feature as well as any other dial-up method that does not provide for PKI authentication for accessing email. 

Determine if the site has implemented a unified mail system where voicemail is delivered via the user’s email mailbox. This will normally imply that email could be available via normal voicemail access from a standard telephone and that the email is read to the user via a text-to-speech conversion feature. Inspect the configuration of the unified messaging and email server to determine if the text-to-speech feature is disabled. Alternately have the ISSO or SA demonstrate compliance with the requirement.

If email is accessible via voicemail without PKI authentication, this is a finding.

NOTE: Access to the email service must already be in compliance with DoD email access policy using PKI. Therefore, this requirement does not apply to accessing and listening to voicemail via the email service.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-19445"><title>Deficient imp'n: disablement endpoint Auto-reg.</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-21496r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1510 (GENERAL)</version><title>The LSC permits the registration and operation of VoIP instruments that have not been previously configured and authorized. That is, auto-registration is not disabled if available</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Traditional telephone systems require physical wiring and/or switch configuration changes to add an instrument to the system. This makes it difficult for someone to add an unauthorized digital instrument to the system. This, however, could be done easier with older analog systems by tapping an existing analog line. With VoIP, this is no longer the case. Some VoIP systems employ an automatic means of detecting and registering a new instrument on the network with the local session controller (LSC) and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. This feature is called ‘auto-registration’ and can be used to initially connect and test un-configured instruments. This presents a vulnerability whereby unauthorized instruments could be added to the system, or instruments could be moved without authorization. Such activity can happen anywhere there is an active network port or outlet. This is not only a configuration management problem but it could also allow theft of services or some other malicious attack. It is recognized however, that auto-registration is necessary during large deployments of VoIP  instruments, as well as a short time thereafter, to facilitate additions and troubleshooting. This applies to initial system setup and to any subsequent large redeployments or additions. Normal, day to day, moves, additions, and changes will require manual registration. Since, it may be possible for an unauthorized VoIP   instrument to easily be added to the system during auto-registration, the registration logs must be compared to the authorized terminal inventory. Alternately the system could have a method of automatically registering only pre-authorized terminals. This feature would support VoIP instruments that are DAA approved for connection from multiple local or remote locations. The Auto-registration feature provided in some VoIP systems creates various issues. In general, this feature allows any end instrument to function using a default configuration, as soon as it is plugged into the network without prior authorization and configuration by an SA. In general, this feature should never be used even in the limited situations mentioned in the requirement, since the SA loses control of the system. In this situation the SA may not know what phones are on the system, or where they are, and since phone numbers are usually assigned out of a pool, there is no SA control over the phone number assignments.

If this was to occur, there could be inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals without the proper clearance or need-to-know. This vulnerability could occur if the endpoint was set to automatically answer a voice, VTC, or collaboration call with audio and video capabilities enabled, or if the endpoint was compromised and remotely controlled. The stated requirements and mitigations involve muting the microphone(s) and disabling or covering the camera(s). These or similar vulnerabilities could exist in PC based communications/collaboration applications due to an auto answer feature or compromised application or platform. As such, the simplest mitigation would be to only operate the software that accesses the microphone and camera when they are needed for communication. This does not work well for a unified communications application that is used to enhance our communications/collaboration capabilities since the application would be running most, if not all of the time when the PC is operating. In this case, the microphone could be muted and camera disabled in software as a mitigation. However, this also may not work well due to the possibility of the communications/collaboration application, microphone, or camera could be remotely activated if the platform or a communications application is compromised. In this case positive physical controls may be required. We must also rely on our defense in depth strategy for protecting our PC applications, including our communications applications, from compromise. Physical disablement such as unplugging from the PC, using a physical mute switch, or covering a camera could work if using external devices. However, this mitigation would not work for embedded microphones and cameras as is the trend in laptops and monitors today. While it may not be easily feasible to physically disable an embedded microphone, the lens of an embedded camera can be covered. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information in aural or visual form&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Cisco Unified Personal Communicator [UC]</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Cisco Unified Personal Communicator [UC]</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1826</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20328r1_fix">Ensure auto-answer capabilities of any voice, video, VTC, UC, or collaboration applications are disabled in the event the application provides audio or video communications services such that the microphone and/or camera could be activated automatically when an incoming call is received.

Note: This does not apply to text based communications such as IM that does not activate a microphone or camera.

Have the IAO or SA demonstrate the operation of the PC communications client applications on PCs in the organization, to determine how they function with regard to the “auto-answer” feature, how the feature is configured, and if it is a user configurable setting. Inspect a random sample of PCs to determine if communication apps are configured in compliance. Place calls to all or minimally a random sample of PCs to determine if any of them automatically answers the call. Inspect SOPs and training materials to determine if this mitigation requirement is disseminated to users. Interview a random sampling of users to determine if they are properly trained on this topic. 

This is a finding if any PC application automatically answers a call, or if the application is configured to allow auto-answer, or if the application cannot be configured to disable auto-answer.

Optimally, the design would place a DHCP server dedicated to providing IP address and configuration information to the VVoIP endpoints separate from the IP address and configuration information to data hosts (workstations etc.). The DHCP server providing VVoIP devices should be in the V_VUC domain having the same address space and VLAN to prevent DHCP requests routed onto the data environment that degrade the separation of the VVoIP environment and the data environment. With centralized management of DHCP (and other services, such as DNS) this separation is obviously eliminated. DHCP requests and responses for voice must reside on a segregated VLAN.
 
The best practice is to manually assign addresses when authorizing the instrument by generating its configuration file. In the event a dedicated DHCP server for VVoIP endpoints is not implemented, the network (i.e., the router controlling access to and from the VVoIP endpoint VLANs) must route VVoIP endpoint DHCP requests directly to the DHCP server in such a manner that prevents traffic to flow between the VVoIP and data VLANs.

 - The DHCP server provides addresses from the segregated VVoIP address space and associated configuration information to VVoIP endpoints exclusively.
 - In the event the DHCP server is not dedicated to VVoIP, ensure it does not provide data addresses and configuration information to the VVoIP endpoints and conversely does not provide VVoIP addresses and configuration information to the data endpoints (hosts or workstations).

Review VVoIP network design to determine the IP address the of VVoIP DHCP server. Alternately, determine the VLAN tag the VVoIP DHCP server uses or responds to or inspect the Ethernet port configuration of the LAN network equipment connected to the DHCP server to determine the VLAN assigned to the port. If the DHCP server’s IP address is not within the designated VVoIP VLAN structure or IP address range, this is a finding.

Inspect the configuration of all DHCP servers within the enclave to determine their address scope(s), and placement within the network for the VVoIP, data, or other VLANs.

Also previously stated is the requirement that the LAN NEs maintain the separation between management network(s) and the production network VLANs by blocking traffic from passing between them. Maintaining this separation is also incumbent upon the managed devices that are connected to both the management and production VLANs.

Individual VVoIP system core devices and traditional TDM based telecom switches connect to their production and management networks or VLANs in different ways. In some cases there are separate dedicated physical management and production interfaces. There may also be one or more physically separate management interfaces. On the other hand these interfaces may be logical or there may be some combination of logical and physical interfaces that support the required production and management traffic. In the event production and management connections use separate interfaces, whether logical or physical, the target/ managed device must not permit one network (physical or logical VLAN) to access another network through the device. That is, the device must not route IP traffic between logical or physical interfaces connected to different VLANs or physical networks that are part of a different logical security zone (protected VLAN) or physical network enclave.

Permitting such routing permit a host on one network or VLAN to gain unauthorized access to a host on another network which can lead to complete corruption of the accessed system or device causing the, loss of availability (denial-of-service), integrity, and information or communications confidentiality.

NOTE: While this specifically addresses a similar situation addressed in the Network Infrastructure STIG that essentially requires that the production side of a managed device must not be accessible from the management interface and vise versa, this requirement extends that requirement to multiple management interfaces. Many DSN switches and DISN IPVS system core devices are managed from the BCPS network and CCSA NOC via one interface and also monitored and potentially managed by the DISA ADIMSS or other NOC. These are separate enclaves which must be protected from inappropriate access between them. In some cases the connections from these enclaves to the managed devices are via separate interfaces on the managed devices. Ergo the requirement the managed device must not pass traffic between these interfaces.

Connect a network scanner to each network or interface in sequence. Scan the IP range(s) of the network(s) connected to the other port(s) on the VVoIP core system/device.

This is a finding in the event the scanner can reach any host on the scanned network.

Procedural example:
1 - Connect the scanner to the production network or connection of the VVoIP core system/device. Scan the address range of the management VLAN or network and any other management network connected to the target. 
1A - If the target device has redundant production interfaces, repeat step 1 for the second interface. 
2 - Connect the scanner to the management network interface and scan the address ranges of the production network and any other attached management networks. 
2A - If there is a second management network connection repeat step 2 for the second management interface.

The expected results are that the scanner should not report or reach any host on the scanned network(s).

NOTE: While a portion of this test might be performed as part of the scan used to check that the VVoIP production and management VLANs are closed thus validating the ACL requirements (providing the proper address ranges are scanned as noted above) a detailed review of the scan results would be required to identify if the hosts that were reached. Additional applicability of that test to this one is dependant upon where in the production or management VLAN the scanner is placed since the ACLS protecting the target VVoIP core device may mask a problem in the target device itself. Therefore it is recommended that an independent scan of the device be performed.

A legacy voice mail platform can connect to a VoIP environment to provide voice mail services for VoIP users. In the same respect, a VoIP voice mail platform can provide voice mail services to the legacy voice users and the VoIP users. Some voice mail systems are also capable of providing unified mail by interacting with email messaging systems. Voicemails when recorded are converted to a .wav or similar digital audio file and sent to the email server as an attachment to an email. The subject line will typically contain the caller ID information if available. The email user can then open the attachment and listen to the voicemail on their PC or whatever device that provides properly authenticated access to the user’s email. 

Since the voicemail server must access the voice network (which, in a VoIP system is the VoIP VLAN system), and the data network (data VLANs) to send the email, caution and control must be exercised to not degrade the separation between the voice and data VLANs. Additionally, if the email server is part of or collocated with the voicemail server, user access to email must also not degrade the separation between the voice and data VLANs. Since this server may have 2 NICs and be connected to both voice and data VLANs, the server must not act as a bridge between the voice and data VLANs.

This is done so that a PC and a workstation can share a single network cable drop and LAN access layer switch port. The PC port can, in general, support any device requiring an Ethernet connection.  In theory, a VoIP phone, a desktop VTC unit could be daisy chained on a single LAN drop.  

These embedded multi-port Ethernet switches must be capable of maintaining the separation of the voice (VVoIP), data, VLANs as well as the VTC VLAN and PC Comm Client VLAN if present. For example the attached PC must not be able to directly access the phone’s or VTU’s configurations or communications traffic. VAN separation helps to prevent this.

NOTE: the switch or endpoint will typically utilize 802.1Q trunking (VLAN tagging) but may use some other means to separate voice and data traffic. Typically when 802.1Q VLAN tagging is used, the phone firmware tags the VoIP packets while the embedded switch passes all packets without modification. This permits devices connected to the PC port to tag their packets and assign the proper VLAN to their traffic type. 802.1Q VLAN tagging enables the LAN to better maintain separation of the traffic and is therefore the preferred method.

The LAN access switch (discrete NE or module in a larger NE) must be capable of, and must be configured to, support the VLAN separation method used by the supported endpoints. The NE may perform this function in various ways as determined by the overall VVoIP system and LAN design. However, the typical (or preferred) method used by an endpoint to maintain VLAN separation is 802.1Q VLAN tagging. As such, the LAN access port and NE needs to support the receipt of tagged packets and handle them appropriately to also maintain VLAN separation. While the NE may retag the packets thereby reassigning the VLAN based on some defined rule, the NE may not strip the tags and mix all traffic together. Furthermore, The LAN access NE supporting LAN cable drops will typically have a VLAN defined for each service (VVoIP, VTC, Data, PC Comm. Client) supported by the endpoints connected to the NE. Traffic within the respective VLANs may flow between different physical ports on the NE but may not change VLANs in the process. This must be done by a routing device (discrete NE or module in a larger NE) and must be controlled by an appropriate ACL. The LAN access layer Ethernet switch may be combined in the same unit with the routing device as in the case of a layer-3 switch or a router containing an Ethernet switch module.

VLAN “hopping” occurs when a tagged frame destined for one VLAN is redirected to a different VLAN, threatening network security. The redirection can be initiated using two methods: “tagging attack” and “double encapsulation.” Frame tagging attacks allow a malicious user on a VLAN to get unauthorized access to another VLAN. For example, if a switch port’s trunk mode were configured as auto (enables a port to become a trunk if the connected switch it is negotiating trunking with has its state set to on or desirable) and were to receive a fake DTP packet specifying trunk on or desirable, it would become a trunk port and it could then start accepting traffic destined for all VLANs that belong to that trunk group. The attacker could start communicating with other VLANs through that compromised port—including the management VLAN. Insuring that trunk mode for any non-trunking port is configured as off can prevent this type of attack. Double encapsulation can be initiated by an attacker who has access to a switch port belonging to the native VLAN of the trunk port. Knowing the victim’s MAC address and with the victim attached to a different switch belonging to the same trunk group, thereby requiring the trunk link and frame tagging, the malicious user can begin the attack by sending frames with two sets of tags. The outer tag that is the attacker’s VLAN ID (probably the well known and omnipresent VLAN 1)  is stripped off by the switch, and the inner tag that will have the victim’s VLAN ID is used by the switch as the next hop and sent out the trunk port. To ensure the integrity of the trunk link and prevent unauthorized access, the native VLAN of the trunk port should be changed from the default VLAN 1  to its own unique VLAN. NOTE: Trunk mode is typically used between LAN switches to extend defined VLANs across a network. This mode is used to interconnect LAN switches and routers with other LAN switches and routers to create a network across multiple NEs. Trunk mode generally requires each packet to be tagged with the VLAN ID that it belongs to. This tagging can follow the 802.1Q standard format or can use a vendor proprietary protocol such as Cisco’s ISL. Access mode on the other hand is used on a switchport that supports a connection to a LAN endpoint device. Typically single endpoint devices connected to a switchport send traffic that does not contain a VLAN tag. In this case, if a VLAN is defined for the endpoint, the switchport is statically assigned to a VLAN. As such, when a packet is received and sent out the “Trunk” the packet is tagged with the VLAN ID. Best practices dictate that the implementation of VVoIP on a network requires one or more VVoIP VLANs be established within the network. Therefore LAN access switchports that support VVoIP and VTC endpoints that do not tag or are capable but not configured to add a VLAN tag to their traffic must be statically assigned to the local VVoIP VLAN. VVoIP  and VTC endpoints that do have the capability of adding the VLAN tag to their traffic typically use 802.1Q format and also typically support a PC port on the device. The PC port is added to the VVoIP or VTC endpoints since it reduces cabling and LAN infrastructure cost. Typically, VVoIP or VTC endpoints that support a PC port pass traffic from this port unchanged whether the traffic is tagged or not, while adding the VVoIP VLAN tag for the locally defined VVoIP VLAN to its VVoIP traffic. As such, a LAN access switchport must now support tagged and untagged traffic and keep the traffic separated. This is done by defining a default “data” VLAN (that is not the default VLAN on the NE such as VLAN 0 or 1) for the switchport in which untagged traffic is placed and defining a secondary VVoIP VLAN that matches the 802.1Q tag used for the VVoIP  traffic. This method maintains the LAN access nature of the port even though it supports multiple VLANs while not requiring it to be configured as a trunk. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.

Doing so permits a PC to share the same LAN drop as a VoIP phone or desktop VTC endpoint. The net effect is reduced installation and maintenance cost for the LAN infrastructure. Endpoints that provide a PC port have an embedded Ethernet switch which is required to support the separation of the PC data traffic from the VVoIP and VTC traffic. This is primarily accomplished by the embedded Ethernet switch in the endpoint supporting VLANs. In support of this, many VVoIP and VTC endpoints have the capability of adding a VLAN tag to their traffic using the 802.1Q format. Typically the PC port traffic is passed to the LAN unchanged whether the traffic is tagged or not, while adding the VVoIP VLAN tag for the locally defined VVoIP VLAN to its VVoIP traffic. 

NOTE: this is a limitation of the switchport access mode. It seems that configuring more than a default and tagged VLAN on a switchport requires the port to be set as a trunk, which is not permissible based on NET1416. This causes a limitation in the number of devices and applications that can be supported by a single switchport and LAN drop. For example, a single switchport will support a single VoIP phone (w/ an embedded switch and PC port) which tags its traffic and a connected PC that does not. Similarly, a single switchport will support a single VTC endpoint (w/ an embedded switch and PC port) which tags its traffic and a connected PC that does not. Similarly, a single switchport will support a single PC that supports a soft phone and tags its VoIP traffic while not tagging its data traffic (per the PCCC STIG). A single port will not support a VoIP phone and a VTC endpoint and a PC on a single drop unless the VTC endpoint also tags its VTC traffic with the VoIP VLAN. If a PC with a compliant soft phone is connected, it must also tag its traffic with the single VoIP VLAN tag. 

NOTE: Traffic to/from a VTC endpoint may use the same VLAN as the VVoIP phone system. Some exceptions may apply. NOTE: Do not use the default VLAN for the switch which is generally VLAN 1. This is used for LAN control traffic. No traffic or interface is permitted to be assigned to the switches’ default VLAN.

One method is MAC-based port security limiting the number of devices that can connect from an endpoint to a network access switch port. Allowing too many MAC addresses on a switch port could allow a hub or switch to be inserted into the voice VLAN port or PC/data port on a VVoIP or VTC endpoint, which allows additional unauthorized devices or workstations to be connected. 

VVoIP and VTC endpoints in the workspace where installed are provisioned with enough LAN drops to support the number of devices to be used in the workspace. This also requires that each LAN drop that is to be used must be connected to a network access switch port. The best practice is to limit the devices permitted to connect to any given LAN drop/switch port combination to one. The two methods do this are static mapping and MAC based port security. Static mapping the MAC address of a pre-authorized device into the configuration of the network access switch port requires manual configuration. The MAC based port security, also known as sticky-MAC, in which the MAC address of the first device to connect to the switch port is learned and added to the configuration. This becomes the authorized device. Sticky-MAC requires care be exercised regarding what device is connected to a port for the first time. In both cases an alarm will be generated if an unauthorized device is connected. 

Many VVoIP or VTC endpoints provide an extra Ethernet port called a PC port that permits the endpoint and another device to share the same LAN drop. This has several advantages. First, a VVoIP or VTC endpoint can be added to a LAN without having to run additional cable or activate additional LAN drops. It is possible to share a single LAN drop with a VVoIP endpoint, a desktop VTC endpoint, and computer. 

Another initiative where a single LAN drop is shared is hot desking, where several people are assigned to work at the same desk at different times, each with their own laptop computer. In this case, a different MAC address needs to be permitted for each laptop that is supposed to connect to the LAN drop in the workspace. Additionally, this workspace could contain a single phone used by all assignees and the PC port on it might be the connection for their laptop. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Enclave Infrastructure</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Enclave Infrastructure</dc:subject><dc:identifier>831</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20356r2_fix">Implement and document the appropriate number of pre-authorized MAC addresses are statically assigned for the pre-authorized VVoIP and VTC endpoints to include daisy chained devices or the maximum number of MAC addresses dynamically learned on each access switch port are limited to the minimum number of supported devices authorized to connect.

This is done via the “success” message sent from the authentication server back to the authenticator. General VVoIP and VTC requirements dictate that traffic from these devices are to be separated from the general LAN traffic and workstations by VLAN and IP address separation or segregation. An implementation of 802.1x within the LAN must support this requirement. As such the authentication server must provide the LAN switch with the proper VLAN configuration depending upon the device that is authenticated. For example, if all LAN ports are configured to use 802.1x LAN access control, and (as the typical case would be) are configured as disabled until a device authenticates, each port must support the authentication of a general workstation (a data device) or a VVoIP endpoint, or a VTC endpoint. If a workstation authenticates, the switch port must be configured with the data VLAN. If a VVoIP endpoint authenticates, the switch port must be configured with the VVoIP VLAN. VTC endpoints must be similarly configured. If a VVoIP endpoint that contains a PC port authenticates, the switch port must be configured with the VVoIP VLAN to receive the VVoIP traffic AND must be configured with the data VLAN to receive traffic from the PC port. Alternately, the switch port must be preconfigured for whatever device is expected to connect while in standby and implement the configuration when activated.

When the network access control implementation uses 802.1x and the network access switch ports are configured as 802.1x authenticators, ensure the VVoIP and VTC endpoints integrate into the 802.1x access control system. If the 802.1x authentication server does not place data, VVoIP, and VTC traffic in the correct VLANs when authorizing LAN access for VVoIP and VTC endpoints, this is a finding.

An example follows: 
If all LAN ports are configured to use 802.1x LAN access control (as the typical case would be), and are configured as disabled until a device authenticates, each port must support the authentication of a general workstation (a data device) or a VVoIP endpoint, or a VTC endpoint. If a work station authenticates, the switch port must be configured with the data VLAN. If a VVoIP endpoint authenticates, the switch port must be configured with the VVoIP VLAN. If a VTC endpoint authenticates, the switch port must be configured with the VTC VLAN. When a VVoIP endpoint that contains a PC port authenticates, the switch port must be configured with the VVoIP VLAN to receive the VVoIP traffic AND must be configured with the data VLAN to receive traffic from the PC port.

When a VVoIP or VTC endpoint provides a PC port, and the PC port is disabled (as required) because the 802.1x implementation cannot control LAN access via the PC port once the endpoint is authorized, the required configuration for the network access switch ports is to configure the appropriate VLAN for the VVoIP or VTC traffic (as required) as well as configuring the “unused” VLAN for the disabled PC port (as required).</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-19655"><title>VVoIP 5315</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-21796r2_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 5315</version><title>When 802.1x is implemented and VVoIP or VTC endpoints provide a PC port, the PC port must be an 802.1x authenticator, or be disabled. </title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A VVoIP or VTC endpoint that provides a PC port typically breaks 802.1x LAN access control mechanisms.

This may permit whatever is connected to the PC port to have access to the LAN even if it is not authorized or uses 802.1x. Therefore, the practice of daisy chaining devices on a single LAN drop protected by 802.1x must be prohibited unless certain mitigating circumstances exist, or are configured. In the event a PC port is provided, the mitigation is to disable the port. However, the 802.1x implementation must install the configuration on the network access switch port required to support a VVoIP or VTC endpoint with a disabled PC port.

Additionally, some IP hardware phones are only capable of providing basic layer 2 connectivity, acting like a hub and combining the data and voice network segments. While other IP phones offer enhanced Layer 2 connectivity providing the option to use VLAN technology, to place the phone and the data traffic on two different VLANs. To ensure logical separation of voice and data in order to maintain the security of the VoIP environment, only layer 2 enhanced or VLAN capable phones should be considered for use. Many attacks on DOD computer systems are launched from within the network by dissatisfied or disgruntled employees, therefore, it is imperative that any active IP Phone data ports be disabled the same as unused physical ports on a network switch. If unauthorized personnel gain access to the VoIP or data environment through an unsecured data port, they could cause disruptions, denial of service conditions, or access sensitive information. Disabling data ports on IP Phones prevents this type of unauthorized and unwanted activity. 

NOTE: It is not typical that the PC port will be used on all endpoints. For example, phones and VTC units in offices typically might be used, while phones in common areas such as a lobby, hallway, or kitchen, etc. will not. Phones and VTC units in conference rooms may or may not, depending upon site policy. In general, these PC ports are the most vulnerable to unauthorized use, and therefore should be disabled until actually required to be used by an authorized LAN user. The specific vulnerability addressed here is unauthorized access to the LAN and/or the endpoints’ configuration and communications traffic.

Additionally, the VVoIP system devices within the enclave are to be addressed using “private” or RFC 1918 addresses. These addresses are different than the addresses used on the NIPRNet. NIPRNet addresses are a subset of the overall public address space used by the Internet. As such, Network Address Translation (NAT) is required at the enclave boundary in order to transfer IP packets into and out of the enclave. The proper place for this to happen is in the EBC.

They broker the establishment of calls between enclaves. A MFSS provides the following functions: 
&gt; Receives AS-SIP-TLS messages from other MFSSs and a specific set of regionally associated LSCs to act as a call routing manager across the backbone. 
&gt; Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to interrogate the ability of another MFSS or a LSC to receive a call, whether routine or priority. 
&gt; Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to manage the establishment of priority calls and the pre-emption of lower priority calls to LSCs and other MFSSs 
&gt; Once a “trunk side” session request is received the MFSS determines if the destination is one of its assigned LSC’s. If so, it interrogates that LSC to determine if it can receive the call. If so, it signals to establish the call. If the destination is not one of its LSCs it signals with other MFSSs to locate the destination LSC and then the remote MFSS negotiates with its LSC. 
&gt; Acts as a backup MFSS for LSCs assigned to other MFSSs as primary. As such, a LSC must be able to signal with a MFSS in order to establish any call across the DISN WAN. LSCs do not interact directly with LSCs. This hierarchical arrangement is required in order to be able to manage and establish priority calls and manage access circuit budgets. We established previously that each LSC must have a backup MFSS. In support of this function MFSSs must be operated in pairs with all the information about its assigned LSCs replicated across the pair.

This is a two-part process that is exacerbated if the call originates from a Multi-Line Telephone System (MLTS). Some of the FCC rules and state laws address the MLTS issue.
For enterprise systems, the support for E911 by the enterprise LSC (or any remote LSC construct) is governed by FCC rules, as well as other federal, state, and local law. The design and implementation of all MLTS systems must include reasonable efforts to provide E911, even when the access connection to the Enterprise LSC is severed.

Public enhanced F&amp;ES systems are implemented in conjunction with the local exchange carrier (LEC) using their central office switch (CO). When the designated F&amp;ES number is dialed, the CO routes the call to the public F&amp;ES answering point (PSAP) over special trunks that can provide the PSAP with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated and the geographic location of the originating telephone. The originating telephone number is provided as Automatic Number Identification (ANI) information. The geographic location of the originating telephone is provided as Automatic Location Identification (ALI) information. The ALI is generated from the ANI by looking up the ANI in a database. Typically this function is performed by the LEC and the ALI provided is the service delivery address for the telephone number. In some cases the ALI information is housed in a database at the PSAP or a at a third party provider such that the PSAP must make the “database dip” to identify the location of the caller. The information is regularly updated by the LEC based on new service deliveries and disconnections.

This process does not go far enough if the originating telephone is behind (part of) a MLTS. An MLTS may serve a large building or may serve multiple buildings in a campus setting. It may also serve small or large remote sites that are geographically distant from the main MLTS switch. As discussed above, the normal process provides the address where the LEC delivers its phone service for the calling number. While this address will serve to get emergency services personnel to the lobby of a building or the front gate of a campus, it will not provide the exact location of the caller. This is where the federal and state MLTS related requirements come in. Under these rules, a MLTS operator and the system itself must provide complete ANI and ALI information to the answering point such that emergency services personnel can easily locate the caller. As such the MLTS must provide the exact location of the originating telephone minimally within a reasonably small area of it. The location information provided for telephones behind a MLTS is called Phone Switch-ALI (PS-ALI). 

To implement this, the MLTS must first be able to provide the F&amp;ES answering station with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated via ANI. If the answering point is outside the MLTS, the number provided must be the exact Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number of the telephone placing the call so that the answering point can dial it directly. The number provided must not be that of an outbound trunk. Secondly, this phone number must be correlated to its physical address or location within the facility via PS-ALI. 

To implement PS-ALI, the owner/operator of a MLTS is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date database containing the telephone number (DID number and/or extension number) and physical location of each telephone attached to the MLTS. This database is then used to provide the PS-ALI information to the ALI database(s) accessed by the F&amp;ES answering point. In association with each telephone and telephone number in the MLTS, the PS-ALI information contained in the database includes the following:
 - The address of the site containing the MLTS unless provided to the answering point by the LEC as part of its ANI/ALI information.
 - The name (or number) of the building in which the telephone is located.
 - The address of the building in which the telephone is located.
 - The floor in the building on which the telephone is located.
 - The area or quadrant of the floor where the telephone is located.
 - The room or cube number where the telephone is located.

Additional information should be provided to the F&amp;ES answering point and emergency services personnel in the form of up-to-date facility maps and floor plans. The maintenance of facility maps, floor plans, and PS-ALI information to keep them up-to-date is critical to life safety and facility protection and security. This can be an onerous process in light of changes in the facility and moves, adds, and changes within the MLTS. Maintaining accurate location information is exacerbated in a VoIP MLTS due to the ability of an IP phone to change its physical location within the LAN (and possibly beyond) while keeping its telephone number without specific intervention from, or knowledge of the MLTS operator. As such the PS_ALI database can quickly become inaccurate. A situation that could be life threatening. 

Automated systems can be used with a VoIP system and LAN to identify the general location of an IP phone within the facility based on the LAN switch and port to which the phone is connected. Once this information is obtained from the LAN, it is correlated with the documented location of the LAN switch and documented location of the outlet served by the switchport.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target TDM Switch Control - Lines &amp; Trunks</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>TDM Switch Control - Lines &amp; Trunks</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1755</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-22299r2_fix">Configure the local DoD Multi-Line Telecommunications System (MLTS), VoIP or traditional, to provide the originating telephone number and the physical location of an F&amp;ES caller to the emergency services answering point through a transfer of Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and Phone Switch Automatic Location Identification (PS-ALI) information or the emergency services answering point is provided automated access to the required PS-ALI database.</fixtext><fix id="F-22299r2_fix" /><check system="C-25750r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_VVOIP Technical.xml" /><check-content>Interview the IAO to validate compliance with the following requirement:

NOTE: In the event the F&amp;ES calls are routed to a public entity outside the MLTS, the call must route to an internal emergency number in parallel with the external call.

In the event a local private answering point is the primary answering point, and if this private answering point is not fully staffed on a 24-7 basis, the MLTS must route F&amp;ES calls to the public answering point when the local answering point is not fully staffed, for example outside the normal working hours of the site. </check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-21513"><title>Deficient security: SIP Cross Site Scripting</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-23722r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1980 (GENERAL)</version><title>Devices and applications using SIP or AS-SIP signaling are vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A cross site scripting vulnerability has been demonstrated in at least one SIP based IP phone.

While this vulnerability was demonstrated on a specific IP phone it could potentially affect all SIP based endpoints or clients and their signaling partners. This vulnerability is a result of improper filtering or validation of the content of the various fields in the SIP invite and potentially the Session Description Protocol (SDP) portion of the invite. The injected code could cause all sorts of malicious code to be run on the target device which could be an endpoint (hard or soft), a session controller, or any other SIP signaling partner.

This is useful when a person is visiting a remote office away from their normal office and typically functions within an established enterprise wide VVoIP system where the system is designed as a contiguous system. In this case, the system is typically a single vendor solution. The system might be within one LAN/CAN may include multiple LAN/CANs at multiple interconnected sites. To activate this feature, the user approaches a phone that is not their regular phone and identifies themselves to the phone system via a username, password, pin, code, or some combination of these. Upon validation, the system configuration manager will configure the temporary phone to match the configuration of the user’s regular phone. Minimally, the phone number is transferred and possibly some or all of the user’s speed dial numbers and other personal preferences. This capability is dependant upon the capabilities of the temporary phone. Once activated the user’s inbound calls are directed to the temporary location. The user’s regular phone may or may not maintain its normal capabilities and also may also answer inbound calls.

NOTE: This feature has nothing to do with LAN access control and is not related to moving physical phones/endpoints/instruments. The phone that is already in the temporary location is already authorized on the LAN and registered with the LSC. Moving phones requires pre-authorization and pre-configuration of the LAN access control mechanisms, potentially including the LSC. This feature should not be used to permanently move users from one office to another. 

NOTE: Extension mobility is similar to but not the same as forwarding ones calls. Forwarding is typically activated from the user’s normal phone or their user preferences configuration settings. Forwarding is therefore pre-set to a known location. Extension mobility is typically activated from the remote location and is activated upon arrival at that location.

Extension mobility poses some vulnerabilities to the VVoIP system, user’s profile information, and conversations if not properly controlled. 

Extension mobility should be available only to those individuals that need to use the feature. There should be a configurable checkbox that enables/disables the feature within the configuration of the user’s normal phone or within the user’s profile. Making the feature available to all users all of the time broadens the exposure for potential compromise of other user’s profile information or conversations.

Activation of the feature must not be via a feature button on the temporary phone or a commonly known code, either of which might be used along with the phone number to be transferred. This would leave all regular user’s phones vulnerable to anybody activating the feature from anywhere in the system to eavesdrop or collect information.

Extension mobility transfer in some systems may have no time limitation. This means the temporary user’s phone configuration, preferences, speed dial information, and phone calls are available at the temporary phone until the transfer feature is deactivated. In the event the user does not specifically deactivate the transfer when they leave, the info is there until someone else deactivates it or another transfer is activated. While users should have the capability to deactivate the transfer at their discretion when they leave, the system should automatically deactivate the feature at some predetermined time of day or after a time period of inactivity. A timed deactivation might use a period of inactivity of one or two hours. Activation of the feature might be for a given period of time, such as eight hours, or for a user configurable time period set when they activate the feature. A time of day deactivation could be set to deactivate all such transfers at midnight each day. This feature might also be used as a backup for other methods.

In the event controls such as those discussed above are not available, an extension mobility feature should be deactivated if the feature is provided or supported by the system.

&gt; Attempt to activate the without authentication. 
&gt; Attempt to activate the feature for a random regular phone number. 
This is a finding in the event the feature activates.

Based on the information obtained in check (1670 A)
&gt; Inspect the configurations in the LSC related to extension mobility feature control and deactivation. 
&gt; If extension mobility feature configuration is contained in the configurations for the phones and/or in the user’s profile configurations, inspect a random sampling of these configurations and inspect a sampling of phone/user’s configurations where the feature is permitted. 
This is a finding if the proper configurations/permissions are not properly set.

Interrupting any of the routing or switching infrastructures will disrupt VVoIP service. If the infrastructure is interrupted, command and control communications are disrupted, preventing critical communications from occurring. When implementing a VVoIP system without considering UPS power needs for the VVoIP controllers and endpoints as well as the entire LAN, and supporting those needs with UPS systems, communications availability is reduced. As such, all elements of the LAN infrastructure, WAN boundary, VVoIP infrastructure, and VVoIP endpoints directly supporting users with precedence needs must be provided with sufficient backup power to meet availability requirements.

Ensure a UPS system is provided for all parts of the VVoIP infrastructure, including the core LSC/MFSS, adjunct systems providing critical services, SBC, CER, LAN elements, and endpoints as follows:
- All VVoIP system devices including portions of the LAN that directly support one or more C2 users are minimally provided 2 hours UPS.
- All C2 user VVoIP endpoints relying on Power over Ethernet (PoE) must have power sourcing equipment (PSE) sized to support the asset and endpoints by the UPS for a minimum 2 hours.
- All C2 user VVoIP endpoints without PoE must be minimally provided 2 hours UPS.
- UPS systems (battery at a minimum; plus optional generator) supplying power to infrastructure that supports special-C2 and C2 users must also support environmental power (HVAC) such that equipment failures are prevented. 
- In no case should a UPS system immediately, or within a short time, drop power to the supported equipment when primary power is removed. This would indicate an undersized or defective UPS unit.

Determine if the infrastructure assets being reviewed directly support one or more C2 users. If no C2 users are supported, this requirement is not applicable. If C2 users are supported, determine if assets are provided with 2 hours of backup power. If 2 hours of backup power is not provided for LAN Infrastructure, WAN boundary, VVoIP infrastructure, and VVoIP endpoints to support C2 users, this is a finding.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-57953"><title>VVoIP 1223 (Non-C2)</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-72383r1_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1223 (Non-C2)</version><title>Sufficient backup power must be provided for LAN Infrastructure, WAN boundary, VVoIP infrastructure, and VVoIP endpoints to support non-C2 user accessible endpoints for emergency life-safety and security calls.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Unified Capabilities (UC) users require different levels of capability depending upon command and control needs.
