Keep the use of Surrogate Users outside of those granted to the scheduling software to a minimum number of individuals.
The simplest configuration is to only use Surrogate resource for the appropriate Scheduling task/software for production scheduling purposes as documented.

Temporary use of surrogate resource of the production batch to the scheduling tasks may be allowed for a period for testing by the appropriate specific production Support Team members. Authorization, eligibility and test period is determined by site policy.

Access authorization is restricted to the minimum number of personnel required for running production jobs. However, Surrogate usage should not become the default for all jobs submitted by individual userids (i.e., system programmer shall use their assigned individual userids for software installation, duties, whereas a Cross Authorized ACID would normally be utilized for scheduled batch production only and as such shall normally be limited to the scheduling task such as CONTROLM) and not granted as a normal daily basis to individual users..

Programs in the PPT can bypass security software mechanisms such as password protection.  Only programs that require special authorizations are coded in the PPT.

The PPT is maintained differently depending upon the level of MVS.  Use the following recommendations and techniques to provide protection for the PPT:

(1)	As part of standard MVS maintenance, systems programming personnel will review the IEFSDPPT module and all programs that IBM has, by default, placed in the PPT to validate their applicability to the execution system.  Please refer to the IBM z/OS MVS Initialization and Tuning Reference documentation for the version and release of z/OS installed at the individual site for the actual contents of the default IEFSDPPT 

(2)	Modules for products not in use on the system will have their special privileges explicitly revoked.  Do this by placing a PPT entry for each module in the SYS1.PARMLIB(SCHEDxx) member, specifying no special privileges.  The PPT entry for each overridden program will be in the following format, accepting the default (unprivileged) values for the sub parameters:

	PPT	PGMNAME(&lt;program name&gt;)

(3)	The Software Support team will assemble documentation regarding these PPT entries, and the IAO will keep it on file.  Include the following in the documentation:

-	The product and release for which the PPT entry was made
-	The last date this entry was reviewed to authenticate status
-	The reason the module's privileges are being revoked</fixtext><fix id="F-16968r1_fix" /><check system="C-20009r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_zOS RACF STIG.xml" /><check-content>a)	Refer to the following report produced by the  z/OS Data Collection:

-	EXAM.RPT(PPTXRPT)

Automated Analysis
Refer to the following report produced by the z/OS Data Collection:

-	PDI(AAMV0160)

b)	Review the program entries in the CA-EXAMINE PPT LIBRARY SEARCH report. For all programs not found on the operating system (i.e., missing link date, size, volume, and library name), review their corresponding entries in the CA-EXAMINE PROGRAM PROPERTIES TABLE ANALYSIS report.  If a program entry is found with any of the following excessive privileges, ensure that a matching SCHEDxx entry exists for that program revoking these privileges:

1)	Data set integrity bypass
2)	Keys 0-7
3)	Security bypass

c)	If a SCHEDxx entry exists for all applicable PPT programs revoking the excessive privileges above, there is NO FINDING.

d)	If a SCHEDxx entry does not exist for an applicable PPT program, or does not revoke all the excessive privileges above, this is a FINDING.

Note:	Modules for products not in use on the system will have their special privileges explicitly revoked.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-100"><title>AAMV0350</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-100r2_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>AAMV0350</version><title>Non-existent or inaccessible LINKLIST libraries.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;LINKLIST libraries give a common access point for the general usage of modules.

Review all entries contained in the LINKLIST for the actual existence of each library. Develop a plan of action to correct deficiencies.

The Linklist is a default set of libraries that MVS searches for a specified program.  This facility is used so that a user does not have to know the library names in which utility types of programs are stored.  Control over membership in the Linklist is specified within the operating system.  The data set SYS1.PARMLIB(LNKLSTxx) is used to specify the library names.  (The xx is the suffix designated by the LNK parameter in the IEASYSxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB, or overridden by the computer operator at IPL.)

Use the following recommendations and techniques to control the exposures created by the LINKLIST facility:

(1)	Avoid inclusion of sensitive libraries in the LNKLSTxx member unless absolutely required.

(2)	The LNKLSTxx and PROGxx (LNKLST entries) members will contain only required libraries.  On a semi annual basis, Software Support should review the volume serial numbers, and should verify them in accordance with the system catalog.  Software Support will remove all non existent libraries.  The IAO should modify and/or delete the rules associated with these libraries.

Review all SMF recording specifications found in SMFPRMxx members. Ensure that SMF recording options used are consistent with those outlined below.

The settings for several parameters are critical to the collection process:

ACTIVE	   Activates the collection of SMF data.

JWT(15)           The maximum amount of consecutive time that an executing job may spend as ineligible to use any CPU resources before being canceled for inactivity.  The requirement for Job Wait Time is 15 minutes.  (This may be extended if controlled through other means, e.g., a Session Manager or ACP.)

NOTE:	The JWT parameter can be greater than 15 minutes if the system is processing unclassified information and the following items are reviewed.
 
1)	If a session is not terminated, but instead is locked out after 15 minutes of inactivity, a process must be in place that requires user identification and authentication before the session is unlocked.  Session lock-out will be implemented through system controls or terminal screen protections.

2)	A system’s default time for terminal lock-out or session termination may be lengthened to 30 minutes at the discretion of the IAM or IAO.  The IAM and/or IAO will maintain the documentation for each system with a time-out adjusted beyond the 15-minute recommendation to explain the basis for this decision.

3)	The IAM and/or IAO may set selected userids to have a time-out of up to 60 minutes in order to complete critical reports or transactions without timing out.  Each exception must meet the following criteria:

(a)	The time-out exception cannot exceed 60 minutes.
(b)	A letter of justification fully documenting the user requirement(s) must be submitted and approved by the site IAM or IAO.  In addition, this letter must identify an alternate means of access control for the terminal(s) involved (e.g., a room that is locked at all times, a room with a cipher lock to limit access, a password protected screen saver set to 30 minutes or less, etc.).
(c)	The requirement must be revalidated on an annual basis.

MAXDORM(0500)   Specifies the amount of real time that SMF allows data to remain in an SMF buffer before it is written to a recording data set.
SID                           Specifies the system ID to be recorded in all SMF records

SYS(DETAIL)           Controls the level of detail recorded.

SYS(INTERVAL)       Ensures the periodic recording of data for long running jobs.

SYS                          Specifies the types and sub types of SMF records that are to be collected.  SYS(TYPE) indicates that the supplied list is inclusive (i.e., specifies the record types to be collected).  Record types not listed are not collected.

File location is an often overlooked factor in system integrity.  It is important to ensure that the effects of hardware failures on system integrity and availability are minimized.

Adequate backup scheduling is also an often overlooked integrity exposure.  Back up system  files on a regular schedule.  Store the backups off site to prevent concurrent loss of the live production system and the backup files.  Backup scheduling will vary depending on the requirements and capabilities of the individual data center.

While the requirements of Data Owners may necessitate more frequent backups, a recommended schedule is as follows:

-	Weekly and monthly full volume backup of volumes with low update activity, such as the operating system volumes

Review access authorization to critical system files. Evaluate the impact of correcting the deficiency. Develop a plan of action and implement the changes as required to protect datasets used to backup and/or dump SMF Collection Files.

In z/OS systems, SMF data is the ultimate record of system activity.  Therefore, SMF data is of the most sensitive and critical nature.  While the length of time for which SMF data will be retained is not specifically regulated, it is imperative that the information is available for the longest possible time period in case of subsequent investigations.  The statute of limitations varies according to the nature of a crime.  It may vary by jurisdiction, and some crimes are not subject to a statute of limitations. Apply the following guidelines to the retention of SMF data for all DOD systems:

(a)	Retain at least two (2) copies of the SMF data.

(b)	Maintain SMF data for a minimum of one year.

(c)	All update and alter access authority to SMF history files will be logged using the ACP’s facilities.  Only systems programming personnel and batch jobs that perform SMF functions will be authorized to update the SMF files.

Suggestion on how to update system to be compliant with this vulnerability:

NOTE:	All examples are only examples and may not reflect your operating environment.

Obtain only the PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures.  The data sets to be reviewed are obtained using the following steps:

-	All data sets contained in the MSTJCLxx member in the DD statement concatenation for IEFPDSI and IEFJOBS.
-	The data set in the PROCxx DD statement concatenation that are within the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions.  The specific PROCxx DD statement that is used is obtained from the PROCLIB entry for the JOBCLASSes of STC and TSU.  The following is what data sets the process will obtain for analysis:

MSTJCL00

//MSTJCL00 JOB MSGLEVEL=(1,1),TIME=1440 
//         EXEC PGM=IEEMB860,DPRTY=(15,15)

PROCLIB data set that will be used in the access authorization process:

SYS3.PROCLIB
SYS2.PROCLIB  
SYS1.PROCLIB 

The following PROCLIB data set will NOT be used or evaluated:

SYS4.USERPROC

Recommendation for sites:

The following are recommendations for the sites to ensure only PROCLIB data sets that contain the STC and TSO procedures are protected.

-	Remove all application PROCLIB data sets from MSTJCLxx and JES2 procedures.  The customer will have all JCL changed to use the JCLLIB JCL statement to refer to the application PROCLIB data sets.

Example:

//USERPROC   JCLLIB ORDER=(SYS4.USERPROC)

-	Remove all access to the application PROCLIB data sets and only authorize system programming personnel WRITE and/or greater access to these data sets.

-	Document the application PROCLIB data set access for the customers that require WRITE and/or greater access.  Use this documentation as justification for the inappropriate access created by the scripts.

-	Change MSTJCLxx and JES2 procedure to identify STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets separate from application PROCLIB data sets.  The following is a list of actions that can be performed to accomplish this recommendation:

a.	Ensure that MSTJCLxx contains only PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures.
b.	If an application PROCLIB data set is required for JES2, ensure that the JES2 procedure specifies more than one PROCxx DD statement concatenation or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions.  Identify one PROCxx DD statement data set concatenation that contains the STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets.  Identify one or more additional PROCxx DD statements that can contain any other PROCLIB data sets.  The concatenation of the additional PROCxx DD statements can contain the same data sets that are identified in the PROCxx DD statement for STC and TSO.  The following is an example of the JES2 procedure:

//JES2     PROC 
//IEFPROC  EXEC PGM=HASJES20,PARM=NOREQ, 
//            DPRTY=(15,15),TIME=1440,PERFORM=9 
//ALTPARM  DD DISP=SHR, 
//            DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2BKUP) 
//HASPPARM DD DISP=SHR, 
//            DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2PARM) 
//PROC00   DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR  
//         DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR
//         DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR 
//PROC01   DD DSN=SYS4.USERPROC,DISP=SHR  
//         DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR  
//         DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR  
//         DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR 
//IEFRDER  DD SYSOUT=* 
//HASPLIST DD DDNAME=IEFRDER

c.	Ensure that the JES2 configuration file is changed to specify that the PROCLIB entry for the STC and TSU JOBCLASSes point to the proper PROCxx entry within the JES2 procedure or JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions that contain the STC and/or TSO procedures.  All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions.  The following is an example of the JES2 initialization parameters:

JOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO,          /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED        (DEF.)*/ 
…
         PROCLIB=01,          /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD     (DEF.)*/
…
JOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL,       /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS         (DEF.)*/ 
…
         PROCLIB=00,          /* USE //PROC00 DD            (DEF.)*/ 
…
JOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL,       /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS         (DEF.)*/
…
         PROCLIB=00,          /* USE //PROC00 DD            (DEF.)*/ 
…

d.	Ensure that only system programming personnel are authorized WRITE and/or greater access to PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures.</fixtext><fix id="F-18125r2_fix" /><check system="C-5459r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_zOS RACF STIG.xml" /><check-content>Refer to the following report produced by the Data Set and Resource Data Collection:

At a minimum an emergency userids will exists with the security administration attributes specified in accordance with the following requirements:

-	Userids exist to perform RACF security administration only.  These userids are defined to RACF with the system-SPECIAL attribute.  They must not have the OPERATIONS attribute.  Emergency userids will have either SPECIAL or OPERATIONS but not both.

-	Userids can be defined to perform operating system functions.  Such userids must be defined without any RACF security administration privileges.  These userids are defined to RACF with the system-OPERATIONS attribute, FULL access to all DASD volumes resources as well as the FACILITY Class STGADMN profiles.

During initialization the TCP/IP stack uses fixed search sequences to locate the PROFILE.TCPIP and TCPIP.DATA files.  However, uncertainty is reduced and security auditing is enhanced by explicitly specifying the locations of the files.  In the TCP/IP started task’s JCL, Data Definition (DD) statements can be used to specify the locations of the files.  The PROFILE DD statement identifies the PROFILE.TCPIP file and the SYSTCPD DD statement identifies the TCPIP.DATA file.

The location of the TCPIP.DATA file can also be specified by coding the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable as a parameter of the ENVAR option in the TCP/IP started task’s JCL.  In fact, the value of this variable is checked before the SYSTCPD DD statement by some processes.  However, not all processes (e.g., TN3270 Telnet Server) will access the variable to get the file location.  Therefore specifying the file location explicitly, both on a DD statement and through the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable, reduces ambiguity.
The systems programmer responsible for supporting ICS will ensure that the TCP/IP started task’s JCL  specifies the PROFILE and SYSTCPD DD statements for the PROFILE.TCPIP and TCPIP.DATA configuration files and TCP/IP started task’s JCL  includes the RESOLVER_CONFIG variable, set to the name of the file specified on the SYSTCPD DD statement.

Ensure they conform to the specifications in the BASE TCP/IP HFS Object Security Settings below:

BASE TCP/IP HFS Object Security Settings
File	Permission Bits	User Audit Bits
/etc/hosts	0744	faf

/usr/lpp/tcpip/bin	0755	faf

Some of the files listed above (e.g., /etc/resolv.conf) are not used in every configuration.  While the absence of a file is generally not a security issue, the existence of a file that has not been properly secured can often be an issue.  Therefore, all directories and files that do exist will have the specified permission and audit bit settings.

The following represents a hierarchy for permission bits from least restrictive to most restrictive:

7	rwx		(least restrictive)
6	rw-
3	-wx
2	-w-
5	r-x
4	r--
1	--x
0	---		(most restrictive)

The possible audit bits settings are as follows:

f	log for failed access attempts
a	log for failed and successful access
-	no auditing

The following commands can be used (from a user account with an effective UID(0)) to update the permission bits and audit bits:

chmod  0744  /etc/hosts
chaudit  w=sf,rx+f  /etc/hosts
chmod  0744  /etc/protocol

Ensure the following items are in effect for TCP/IP resources.

(Note:  The resource class, resources, and/or resource prefixes identified below are examples of a possible installation.  The actual resource class, resources, and/or resource prefixes are determined when the product is actually installed on a system through the product’s installation guide and can be site specific.)

Ensure that the EZA, EZB and IST resources and/or generic equivalent are defined to the SERVAUTH resource class with a UACC(NONE)

No access is given to the EZA, EZB, and IST resources of the SERVAUTH resource class.

If the product CSSMTP is on the system, no access is given to EZB.CSSMTP of the SERVAUTH resource class. EZB.CSSMTP.sysname.writername.JESnode will be specified and made available to the CSSMTP started task and authenticated users that require access to use CSSMTP for e-mail services.

Only authenticated users that require access are permitted access to the second level of the resources in the SERVAUTH resource class. Examples are the network (NETACCESS), port (PORTACCESS), stack (STACKACCESS), and FTP resources in the SERVAUTH resource class.

The EZB.STACKACCESS. resource access authorizations restrict access to those started tasks with valid requirements and users with valid FTP access requirements.

The EZB.FTP.*.*.ACCESS.HFS) resource access authorizations restrict access to FTP users with specific written documentation showing a valid requirement exists to access OMVS files and Directories.

The following commands are provided as a sample for implementing resource controls:

RDEF SERVAUTH EZB.** UACC(NONE) OWNER(ADMIN) AUDIT(FAILURE(READ))
RDEF SERVAUTH EZB.CSSMTP.** UACC(NONE) OWNER(ADMIN) AUDIT(FAILURE(READ))

PE EZB.STACKACCESS.** CL(SERVAUTH) ID(authusers) ACC(READ)
PE EZB.STACKACCESS.sysname.TCPIP CL(SERVAUTH) ID(ftpprofile) ACC(READ)

The following notes apply to these controls:

-	EZB.STACKACCESS.sysname.TCPIP access READ should be limited to only those started tasks that require access to the TCPIP Stack as well as any users approved for FTP Access (inbound and/or outbound).   FTP users should not have access to the  EZB.FTP.sysname.ftpstc.ACCESS.HFS resource unless specific written justification documenting valid requirement for those FTP users to access USS files and directories via FTP. 

-	To be effective in restricting access, the network (EZB.NETACCESS) resource control requires configuration of the NETACCESS statement in the PROFILE.TCPIP file.

-	To be effective in restricting access, the port (EZB.PORTACCESS) resource control requires configuration of a PORT or PORTRANGE statement in the PROFILE.TCPIP file.  These port definitions within PROFILE.TCPIP shall be defined to include SAF keyword and a valid name.

Within each BEGINVTAM statement block, one BEGINVTAM USSTCP statement is coded that specifies only the table name operand.  No client identifier, such as host name or IP address, is specified so the statement applies to all connections not otherwise controlled.

The USS table specified on each “back stop” USSTCP statement mentioned above is coded to allow access only to session manager applications and NC PASS applications

Within each BEGINVTAM statement block, additional BEGINVTAM USSTCP statements that specify a USS table that allows access to other applications may be coded only if the statements include a client identifier operand that references only secure terminals.

Any BEGINVTAM DEFAULTAPPL statement that does not specify a client identifier, or specifies any type of client identifier that would apply to unsecured terminals, specifies a session manager application or an NC PASS application as the application name


For z/OS systems, any BEGINVTAM LUMAP statement, if used with the DEFAPPL operand and applied to unsecured terminals, specifies only a session manager application or an NC PASS application.

Further explanation:

After a connection from a Telnet client to the TN3270 Telnet Server has been established, the process of session setup with a VTAM application occurs.  A number of BEGINVTAM statements will be coded in a specific configuration to ensure that adequate control over access to VTAM applications is maintained.

Connections originate from secure terminals or unsecured terminals. The TN3270 Telnet Server should be configured to address these two types of connections.  Terminals should meet two conditions to be considered secure.  One condition involves the hardware and configuration.  Secure terminals include devices that are directly attached to the host, such as 3270-type terminals coax connected to a 3174 Control Unit.  They also include PCs running 3270 terminal emulation clients attached to a private LAN (i.e., a LAN without access to an external network such as the NIPRNet).  The other condition involves the location of the terminals.  Secure terminals are located in areas with physical access limited to authorized personnel.  Examples of terminals that are not secure are those attached via the NIPRNet or via dial-in servers.  The intent of this distinction is to allow additional connection options (e.g., bypassing session manager control) to authorized personnel working in controlled access areas.  These connection options may be necessary for operational control or for system recovery procedures.

The BEGINVTAM USSTCP statement can be used to specify a customized Unformatted System Services (USS) table for client connections.  The USS table can provide a level of access control by restricting the commands that allow connections to VTAM applications.  The USS table specified by the USSTCP statement can be the same as the one used by the SNA component of IBM Communications Server.

The BEGINVTAM DEFAULTAPPL statement can be used to specify the VTAM application to which a client is automatically connected when a session is established using a protocol other than linemode protocol.

The BEGINVTAM LUMAP statement can specify a default VTAM application using the DEFAPPL operand.  This processing is similar to the DEFAULTAPPL and LINEMODEAPPL processing, except that a client identifier should be coded.  When a client matches the LUMAP specification, the DEFAPPL specification overrides the DEFAULTAPPL or LINEMODEAPPL specifications.</fixtext><fix id="F-18187r1_fix" /><check system="C-20049r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_zOS RACF STIG.xml" /><check-content>a)	Refer to the Profile configuration file specified on the PROFILE DD statement in the TCPIP started task JCL.

b)	Ensure the following items are in effect for the configuration statements specified in the TCP/IP Profile configuration file:

NOTE: If the INCLUDE statement is coded in the TCP/IP Profile configuration file, the data set specified on this statement must be checked for the following items as well.

1)	Within each BEGINVTAM statement block, one BEGINVTAM USSTCP statement is coded that specifies only the table name operand.  No client identifier, such as host name or IP address, is specified so the statement applies to all connections not otherwise controlled.
2)	The USS table specified on each “back stop” USSTCP statement mentioned in Item (1) above is coded to allow access only to session manager applications and NC PASS applications.
3)	Within each BEGINVTAM statement block, additional BEGINVTAM USSTCP statements that specify a USS table that allows access to other applications may be coded only if the statements include a client identifier operand that references only secure terminals.
4)	Any BEGINVTAM DEFAULTAPPL statement that does not specify a client identifier, or specifies any type of client identifier that would apply to unsecured terminals, specifies a session manager application or an NC PASS application as the application name.
5)	Any BEGINVTAM LUMAP statement, if used with the DEFAPPL operand and applied to unsecured terminals, specifies only a session manager application or an NC PASS application.

NOTE: The BEGINVTAM LINEMODEAPPL requirements will not be reviewed at this time.  Further testing must be performed to determine how the CL/Supersession and NC-PASS applications work with line mode.

File	Permission Bits	User Audit Bits
/usr/sbin/otelnetd	1740	fff

NOTE:
The /usr/sbin/otelnetd object is a symbolic link to /usr/lpp/tcpip/sbin/otelnetd.  The permission and user audit bits on the target of the symbolic link must have the required settings.

The following represents a hierarchy for permission bits from least restrictive to most restrictive:

7	rwx		(least restrictive)
6	rw-
3	-wx
2	-w-
5	r-x
4	r--
1	--x

The possible audit bits settings are as follows:

f	log for failed access attempts
a	log for failed and successful access
-	no auditing

The following commands can be used (from a user account with an effective UID(0)) to update the permission bits and audit bits:

chmod  1740  /usr/lpp/tcpip/sbin/otelnetd

The FTP daemon program can accept parameters in the JCL procedure that is used to start the daemon.  The ANONYMOUS and ANONYMOUS= keywords are designed to allow anonymous FTP connections.  The INACTIVE keyword is designed to set the timeout value for inactive connections.  Control of these options is recommended through the configuration file statements rather than the startup parameters.

The systems programmer responsible for supporting ICS will ensure that the startup parameters for the FTP daemon does not include the ANONYMOUS, ANONYMOUS=, or INACTIVE  keywords.

During initialization the FTP daemon searches multiple locations for the TCPIP.DATA and FTP.DATA files according to fixed sequences.   In the daemon’s started task JCL, Data Definition (DD) statements will  be used to specify the locations of the files.  The SYSTCPD DD statement identifies the TCPIP.DATA file and the SYSFTPD DD statement identifies the FTP.DATA file.

The systems programmer responsible for supporting ICS will ensure that the FTP daemon’s started task JCL specifies the SYSTCPD and SYSFTPD DD statements for configuration files.

The FTP Server can provide audit data in the form of SMF records.  SMF record type 119, the TCP/IP Statistics record, can be written with the following subtypes:

70 – Append
70 – Delete and Multiple Delete
72 – Invalid Logon Attempt
70 – Rename
70 – Get (Retrieve) and Multiple Get
70 – Put (Store and Store Unique) and Multiple Put

SMF data produced by the FTP Server provides transaction information for both successful and unsuccessful FTP commands.  This data may provide valuable information for security audit activities.  Type 119 records use a more standard format and provide more information.</fixtext><fix id="F-18166r2_fix" /><check system="C-2761r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_zOS RACF STIG.xml" /><check-content>Refer to the Data configuration file specified on the SYSFTPD DD statement in the FTP started task JCL.

The /etc/syslog.conf file may not be the configuration file the daemon uses. It is necessary to check the script or JCL used to start the daemon to determine the actual configuration file.  For example, in /etc/rc:

_BPX_JOBNAME='SYSLOGD'  /usr/sbin/syslogd  -f  /etc/syslog.conf

For example, in the SYSLOGD started task JCL:

//SYSLOGD  EXEC PGM=SYSLOGD,REGION=30M,TIME=NOLIMIT 
//       PARM='POSIX(ON)  ALL31(ON)/  -f  /etc/syslogd.conf'

The HFS permission bits and user audit bits for each directory and file match or are more restrictive than the specified settings listed in the table.  If the guidance is true, this is not a finding.

SYSLOG Daemon HFS Object Security Settings
File	Permission Bits	User Audit Bits
/usr/sbin/syslogd	1740	fff
[Configuration File]
/etc/syslog.conf	0744	faf
[Output log file defined in the configuration file]
	0744	fff

NOTES:
The /usr/sbin/syslogd object is a symbolic link to /usr/lpp/tcpip/sbin/syslogd.  The permission and user audit bits on the target of the symbolic link must have the required settings.

The /etc/syslog.conf file may not be the configuration file the daemon uses.  It is necessary to check the script or JCL used to start the daemon to determine the actual configuration file.  For example, in /etc/rc:

_BPX_JOBNAME='SYSLOGD'  /usr/sbin/syslogd  -f  /etc/syslog.conf

For example, in the SYSLOGD started task JCL:

//SYSLOGD  EXEC PGM=SYSLOGD,REGION=30M,TIME=NOLIMIT 
//       PARM='POSIX(ON)  ALL31(ON)/  -f  /etc/syslogd.conf'

//SYSLOGD  EXEC PGM=SYSLOGD,REGION=30M,TIME=NOLIMIT 
//       PARM='POSIX(ON)  ALL31(ON) /-f //''SYS1.TCPPARMS(SYSLOG)'''

The following represents a hierarchy for permission bits from least restrictive to most restrictive:

7	rwx		(least restrictive)
6	rw-
3	-wx
2	-w-
5	r-x
4	r--
1	--x

The possible audit bits settings are as follows:

f	log for failed access attempts
a	log for failed and successful access

This process must contain an audit trail of reviews. Recommend NIST Special Publication 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management as a guideline for establishing Log Management policy.

DoD has defined the information system auditable events as successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels), successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system. All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations. All kernel module loads, unloads, and restarts.

Possible areas for review may be as follows:

1)       A User attempting to read/update/delete/alter a critical dataset which the STIG prohibits: 
a)         Security database files, and security setup
b)         System parmlib such as SYS1.PARMLIB

A user is defined as either an individual accessing a computer resource, or as a task executing on the system that requires access to a resource.  On z/OS systems a user is identified by means of a unique userid.  Security requires that audit data record the identity of the user, time of access, interaction with the system, and sensitive functions that might permit a user or program to modify, bypass, or negate security safeguards.

-	Where a group field indicates webadmg1, the ID of a local web server administration group is intended.  IMWEB is not a valid local group.
-	The site is free to set the permission and audit bit settings to be more restrictive than the documented values.

Ensure the HFS permission bits, user audit bits, owner, and group for each directory and file match the specified settings listed in the HFS Permission Bits table in the z/OS STIG Addendum.  Currently the guidance requires the permissions on these files to be 640, where the group is the SA or web manager account that controls the web service. However the group permission only allows READ access making it impossible to update files unless using a UID(0) account.  There appears to be a conflict with this requirement.  Proposed updates include changing permissions from 640 to 460. The owner will be the web server user account and the group will be the web server administrator group.
 
Verification of these proposed changes needs to be performed. Until this occurs, compliance of the WAS configuration and property files cannot be reviewed. An entry for was.conf file settings needs to be added. Settings for the WebSphere properties and bin directories may be desirable.

The following represents a hierarchy for permission bits from least restrictive to most restrictive:

-	IEALPAxx specifies the names of modules that will be loaded from the following:

?	SYS1.SVCLIB
?	The LPALSTxx concatenation
?	The LNKLSTxx concatenation as a temporary extension to the existing Pageable

LPA (PLPA) in the Modified LPA (MLPA) for the duration of an IPL.  (The xx is the suffix designated by the MLPA parameter in the IEASYSxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB or overridden by the computer operator at IPL.)

Use the following recommendations and techniques to control the exposures created by the LPA facility:

(1)	The LPALSTxx, IEAFIXxx, and IEALPAxx members will contain only required libraries.  On a semi annual basis, Software Support should review the volume serial numbers, and should verify them in accordance with the system catalog.  Software Support will remove all non existent libraries.  The IAO should modify and/or delete the rules associated with these libraries.

Note that this guidance addresses RJE Workstations that are "Dedicated".  If an RJE workstation is dedicated, the assumption is that the RJE to host connection is hard-wired between the RJE and host. In this case the RMT definition statement will contain the keyword LINE= which specifies that this RJE is only connected via that one LINE statement. 

There are no known non-dedicated RJE Workstations in use within CSD.  If such devices are used, the site should open a ticket with the FSO and jointly develop proper security controls.

a)	Review the JES2 parameters for RJE workstation definitions by searching for RMT( in the report.

b)	Ensure the RJE workstation userids are defined as follows:

1)	A userid of RMTnnnn is defined to RACF for each RJE workstation, where nnnn is the number on the RMT statement.

2)	No userid segments (e.g., TSO, CICS, etc.) are defined.

3)	Restricted from accessing all data sets and resources with exception of the corresponding JESINPUT-class profile for that remote.

Review Chapter 17 of the RACF Security Admin Guide.  The following is an example that show proper implementation:

AG RMTGRP OWNER(ADMIN) SUPGROUP(ADMIN)

AU RMT777 NAME('RMT RJE 777') DFLTGRP(RMTGRP) OWNER(RMTGRP) DATA('COMPLY WITH ZJES0011') NOPASS RESTRICTED

PE RMT777 CL(JESINPUT) ID(RMT777)

c)	Ensure that a FACILITY-Class profile exists in the format RJE.RMTnnnn where nnn identifies the remote number.

Note that this guidance addresses RJE Workstations that are "Dedicated".  If an RJE workstation is dedicated, the assumption is that the RJE to host connection is hard-wired between the RJE and host. In this case the RMT definition statement will contain the keyword LINE= which specifies that this RJE is only connected via that one LINE statement. 

There are no known non-dedicated RJE Workstations in use within CSD.  If such devices are used, the site should open a ticket with the FSO and jointly develop proper security controls.

a)	Refer to the following report produced by the z/OS Data Collection:

-	PARMLIB(JES2 parameters)

Refer to the following report produced by the RACF Data Collection:
-	RACFCMDS.RPT(LISTUSER)

b)	Review the JES2 parameters for RJE workstation definitions by searching for RMT( in the report.

c)	Ensure the RJE workstation userids are defined as follows:

1)	A userid of RMTnnnn is defined to RACF for each RJE workstation, where nnnn is the number on the RMT statement.

2)	No userid segments (e.g., TSO, CICS, etc.) are defined.

3)	Restricted from accessing all data sets and resources with exception of the corresponding JESINPUT class profile for that remote.

NOTE:	Execute the JCL in CNTL(IRRUT100) using the RACF RMTnnnn userids as SYSIN input.  This report lists all occurrences of these userids within the RACF database, including data set and resource access lists.

d)	Ensure that a FACILITY-Class profile exists in the format RJE.RMTnnnn where nnn identifies the remote number.

e)	If all of the above are true, there is NO FINDING.

f)	If any of the above are untrue, this is a FINDING.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-6918"><title>ZJES0014</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-7318r2_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>ZJES0014</version><title>RJE workstations and NJE nodes are not controlled in accordance with STIG requirements.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;JES2 RJE workstations and NJE nodes provide a method of sending and receiving data (e.g., jobs, job output, and commands) from remote locations.

Review the following resources defined to the JESSPOOL resource class:

Ensure the following resources are defined to the JESSPOOL resource class with a UACC(NONE):

localnodeid.JES2.$TRCLOG.taskid.*.JESTRACE
localnodeid.+MASTER+.SYSLOG.jobid.*.SYSLOG or
localnodeid.+BYPASS+.SYSLOG.jobid.*.SYSLOG

NOTE:	These resource profiles may be more generic as long as they pertain directly to the JESTRACE and SYSLOG data sets.  For example:

localnodeid.JES2.$TRCLOG.*.**
localnodeid.+MASTER+.SYSLOG.*.** or
localnodeid.+BYPASS+.SYSLOG.*.**

NOTE:	Review the JES2 parameters to determine the localnodeid by searching for OWNNODE in the NJEDEF statement, and then searching for NODE(nnnn) (where nnnn is the value specified by OWNNODE).  The NAME parameter value specified on this NODE statement is the localnodeid.  Another method is to issue the JES2 command $D NODE,NAME,OWNNODE=YES to obtain the NAME of the OWNNODE.

Ensure that access authorization for the resources mentioned above is restricted to the following:

Userid(s) associated with external writer(s) can have complete access.

NOTE:	An external writer is a STC that removes data sets from the JES spool.  In this case, it is responsible for archiving the JESTRACE and SYSLOG data sets.  The STC default name is XWTR and the external writer program is called IASXWR00. 

Systems personnel and security administrators responsible for diagnosing JES2 and z/OS problems can have complete access.

Ensure the following items are in effect for JESSPOOL resources.  The JESSPOOL may have more restrictive security at the direction of the IAO.

The JESSPOOL resources may be fully qualified, be specified as generic, or be specified with masking as indicated below:

localnodeid.userid.jobname.jobid.dsnumber.name

localnodeid	The name of the node on which the SYSIN or SYSOUT data set currently resides.

userid		The userid associated with the job.  This is the userid used for validation purposes when the job runs.

jobname		The name that appears in the name field of the JOB statement.

jobid		The job number JES2 assigned to the job.

dsnumber		The unique data set number JES2 assigned to the spool data set.  A D is the first character of this qualifier.

name		The name of the data set specified in the DSN= parameter of the DD statement.  If the JCL did not specify DSN= on the DD statement that creates the spool data set, JES2 uses a question mark (?).

By default a user has access only to that user’s own JESSPOOL resources.  However, situations exist where a user legitimately requires access to jobs that run under another user’s userid.  In particular, if a user routes SYSOUT to an external writer, the external writer should have access to that user’s SYSOUT. 

The localnodeid. resource will be restricted to only system programmers, operators, and automated operations personnel with access of ALTER.  All access will be logged.  (localnodeid. resource includes all generic and/or masked permissions, example: localnodeid.**, localnodeid.*, etc)

The JESSPOOL localnodeid.userid.jobname.jobid.dsnumber.name, whether generic and/or masked, can be made available to users, when approved by the IAO.  Access will be identified at the minimum access for the user to accomplish the users function, SERVICE(READ, UPDATE, DELETE, ADD).  All access will be logged.  An example is team members within a team, providing the capability to view, help, and/or debug other team member jobs/processes.  If frequent situations occur where users working on a common project require selective access to each other's jobs, then the installation may delegate to the individual users the authority to grant access, but only with the approval of the IAO.

If IBM’s SDSF product is installed on the system, resources defined to the JESSPOOL resource class control functions related to jobs, output groups, and SYSIN/SYSOUT data sets on various SDSF panels.

CSSMTP will not be granted to the JESSPOOL resource of the high level “node.” or “localnodeid.” .  CSSMTP can have access to the specific approved JESSPOOL resources, minimally qualified to the node.userid. and all access will be logged.  This will ensure system records who (userid) sent traffic to CSSMTP, when and what job/process.

Spooling products users (CA-SPOOL, CA View, etc.) will be restricted to localnodeid.userid.jobname.jobid.dsnumber.name, whether generic and/or masked when approved by the IAO.  Logging of access is not required.

These commands are subject to various types of potential abuse. For this reason, it is necessary to place restrictions on the JES2 system commands that can be entered by particular operators.

Some commands are particularly dangerous and should only be used when less drastic options have been exhausted. Misuse of these commands can create a situation in which the only recovery is an IPL.

To control access to JES2 system commands, apply the following recommendations when
implementing security:

1)	Define the JES2.** resource in the OPERCMDS class with a default access of NONE and all access is logged.

2)	Define the JES2 system commands as specified in the "Controls on JES2 System Commands" table, in the  zOS STIG Addendum restricts access to the appropriate personnel (e.g., operations staff, systems programming personnel, general users).

NOTE:	Use the GROUP category specified in the table referenced above as a guideline to determine appropriate personnel access to system commands.

3)	Define the JES2 system commands with proper logging as specified in the "Controls on JES2 System Commands" table, in the  zOS STIG Addendum.

USERIDALIASTABLE	Will not be specified.
ROOT	SETUID will be specified

STARTUP_PROC	OMVS

BPXPRMxx is the SYS1.PARMLIB member that contains the parameters that control the z/OS UNIX environment.  BPXPRMxx controls the way features work and it establishes logical access to data by configuring the HFS environment.

The SUPERUSER parameter specifies the userid to be assigned to users when the su command is entered without a userid operand.  The userid must be defined to the ACP as BPXROOT and have a UID of 0.

The TTYGROUP parameter specifies the group name assigned to pseudo terminals (PTYs) and remote terminals (RTYs).  The group must be defined to the ACP with a unique GID and users must not be assigned to this group.  This group name is used by some shell commands (e.g., talk and write) when writing to the PTY or RTY being used by another user.  The name TTY must be used.

The STEPLIBLIST parameter specifies the pathname of the HFS file that contains the list of MVS data sets that are used as step libraries for programs that have the set-user-id or set group id permission bit set.  The use of STEPLIBLIST is at the site’s discretion, but if used the value of STEPLIBLIST will be /etc/steplib.  All update and alter access to the MVS data sets in the list will be logged and only systems programming personnel will be authorized to update the data sets.  

The USERIDALIASTABLE parameter specifies the pathname of the HFS file that contains a list of userids and group names with their corresponding alias names.  The alias table is intended primarily for use where mixed or lower case userids are used in the UNIX environment.  Because the z/OS/ MVS components support only upper case userids, the USERIDALIASTABLE will not be used.

The ROOT parameter specifies data for the file system that is to be mounted as the root file system for z/OS UNIX.  ROOT can have a number of sub-parameters; the FILESYSTEM and SETUID|NOSETUID sub-parameters have security considerations.  FILESYSTEM can be used to specify the name of the MVS HFS data set that holds the root file system.  As the highest point in the HFS hierarchy, this file system is critical to system operations.  Therefore appropriate ACP access rules must be written to protect the named data set.  Update and alter access must be restricted to the z/OS UNIX kernel and individual systems programming personnel.  The SETUID|NOSETUID sub-parameter specifies whether or not the set-user-ID or set-group-ID permission bits are supported.  SETUID|NOSETUID also impacts the APF authorized and program-controlled extended attributes.  For the root file system, SETUID must be specified for normal operations.

The MOUNT parameter specifies data for a file system that is to be mounted by z/OS UNIX.  There are usually multiple MOUNT statements and each can have a number of sub-parameters.  The FILESYSTEM, SETUID|NOSETUID, and SECURITY|NOSECURITY sub-parameters have significant security considerations.  FILESYSTEM can be used to specify the name of the MVS HFS data set that holds the logical file system.  Appropriate ACP access rules must be written to protect the named data set.  Update and alter access must be restricted to the z/OS UNIX kernel and to individual systems programming personnel.  The SETUID|NOSETUID sub parameter specifies whether or not the set-user-ID or set group ID permission bits are supported.  SETUID|NOSETUID also impacts the APF authorized and program-controlled extended attributes.  SETUID may be specified for those file systems that contain only vendor-provided software or that have been documented to the IAO as requiring this support.  Otherwise NOSETUID must be specified.  The SECURITY|NOSECURITY sub-parameter specifies whether security checks are performed.  SECURITY must be specified unless a specific exception for the file system has been identified and documented to the IAO.  Regardless of IBM defaults, the values for SETUID|NOSETUID and SECURITY|NOSECURITY must be explicitly coded to protect against potential vendor changes and to simplify security reviews.

The STARTUP_PROC parameter specifies the name of the JCL procedure (PROC) that starts the z/OS UNIX component.  This started task must be defined to the ACP.  The name OMVS must be used.</fixtext><fix id="F-18943r1_fix" /><check system="C-3860r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_zOS RACF STIG.xml" /><check-content>a)	Review the logical parmlib data sets, example: SYS1.PARMLIB(BPXPRMxx), for the following UNIX Parameter Keywords and Values:

The /etc/profile file is the system-wide profile that is executed for each user’s shell invocation.  It provides a default environment for users.  It sets environment variables and executes commands.  Although there are several variables and commands that can be included, those with notable security considerations are the STEPLIB variable and the UMASK command.  The STEPLIB variable should be assigned a value of none in /etc/profile unless a specific requirement for another value exists.  The use of STEPLIB must be coordinated with the SYS1.PARMLIB(BPXPRMxx) STEPLIBLIST control, the /etc/steplib file, and the use of RTLS.

The following scenario describes how to securely define a dead-letter queue:

(1)	Define the real dead-letter queue with attributes PUT(ENABLED) and GET(ENABLED).

(2)	Give update authority for the dead-letter queue to CKTI (the MQSeries/WebSphere MQ-supplied CICS task initiator), channel initiators, and any automated application used for dead-letter queue maintenance.

(3)	Define an alias queue that resolves to the real dead-letter queue, but give the alias queue the attributes PUT(ENABLED) and GET(DISABLED).

(4)	To put a message on the dead-letter queue, an application uses the alias queue.  The application does the following:

(a)	Retrieve the name of the real dead-letter queue.  To do this, it opens the queue manager object using MQOPEN, and then issues an MQINQ to get the dead-letter queue name.

(b)	Build the name of the alias queue by appending the characters “.PUT” to this name, in this case, ssid.DEAD.QUEUE.PUT.

(c)	Open the alias queue, ssid.DEAD.QUEUE.PUT.

(d)	Put the message on the real dead-letter queue by issuing an MQPUT against the alias queue.

(5)	Give the userid associated with the application update authority to the alias, but no access to the real dead-letter queue.

NOTE:	If an alias queue is not used in place of the dead-letter queue, then the ACP rules for the dead-letter queue will be coded to restrict unauthorized users and systems from reading the messages on the file.

Undeliverable messages can be routed to a dead-letter queue.  Two levels of access should be established for these queues.  The first level allows applications, as well as some MQSeries / WebSphere MQ objects, to put messages to this queue.  The second level restricts the ability to get messages from this queue and protects sensitive data.  This will be accomplished by defining an alias queue that resolves to the real dead-letter queue, but defines the alias queue with the attributes PUT(ENABLED) and GET(DISABLED).  The ability to get messages from the dead-letter queue will be restricted to message channel agents (MCAs), CKTI (MQSeries/WebSphere MQ-supplied CICS task initiator), channel initiators utility, and any automated application used for dead-letter queue maintenance.

NOTE:	ssid is the queue manager name (a.k.a., subsystem identifier).

b)	Review the ssid report(s) and perform the following steps:

1)	Find the DISPLAY QMGR DEADQ command to locate the start of the dead-letter queue information.  Review the DEADQ parameter to obtain the name of the real dead-letter queue.

2)	From the top of the report, find the QUEUE(dead-letter.queue.name) entry to locate the start of the real dead-letter queue definition.  Review the GET and PUT parameters to determine their values, and ensure they conform to the

All of these resources might not be used in every configuration, but several of them have critical impacts.

The default access for each of these resources must be no access.  A generic resource (e.g., BPX.**) must also be set to a default access of none to cover future additions.  Because they convey especially powerful privileges, the settings for BPX.DAEMON, BPX.SAFFASTPATH, BPX.SERVER, and BPX.SUPERUSER require special attention.

Access to BPX.DAEMON must be restricted to the z/OS UNIX kernel userid, z/OS UNIX daemons (e.g., inetd, syslogd, ftpd), and other system software daemons (e.g., web servers).

As noted above, the BPX.SAFFASTPATH definition can cause successful security checks not to be audited.  Because auditing of all accesses is required for some system files, BPX.SAFFASTPATH must not be used.  

Access to BPX.SERVER must be restricted to system software processes that act as servers under z/OS UNIX (e.g., web servers).

Access to BPX.SUPERUSER must be restricted to Security Administrators and individual systems programming personnel.  It is not appropriate for all systems programming personnel, only for those with responsibilities for components or products that use z/OS UNIX and that require superuser capability for maintenance.

1)	The RACF rules for the BPX.** resource specify a default access of NONE.
2)	There are no RACF user access to the BPX.** resource.
3)	There is no RACF rule for BPX.SAFFASTPATH defined.
4)	The RACF rules for each of the BPX resources listed in "General Facility Class BPX Resources" table in the zOS STIG Addendum specify a UACC value of NONE.
5)	The RACF rules for each of the BPX resources listed in the "General Facility Class BPX Resources" table in the zOS STIG Addendum restrict access to appropriate system tasks or systems programming personnel as specified.

The ACP data set rules for the data sets referenced in the ROOT and the MOUNT statements in BPXPRMxx restrict update access to the z/OS UNIX kernel (i.e., OMVS or OMVSKERN

The ACP data set rules for the data set referenced in the ROOT and the MOUNT statements in BPXPRMxx restrict update and/or allocate access to systems programming personnel

The ROOT parameter specifies data for the file system that is to be mounted as the root file system for z/OS UNIX.  ROOT can have a number of sub-parameters; the FILESYSTEM and SETUID|NOSETUID sub-parameters have security considerations.  FILESYSTEM can be used to specify the name of the MVS HFS data set that holds the root file system.  As the highest point in the HFS hierarchy, this file system is critical to system operations.  Therefore appropriate ACP access rules must be written to protect the named data set.  Update and alter access must be restricted to the z/OS UNIX kernel and individual systems programming personnel.  The SETUID|NOSETUID sub-parameter specifies whether or not the set-user-ID or set-group-ID permission bits are supported.  SETUID|NOSETUID also impacts the APF authorized and program-controlled extended attributes.  For the root file system, SETUID must be specified for normal operations.

The MOUNT parameter specifies data for a file system that is to be mounted by z/OS UNIX.  There are usually multiple MOUNT statements and each can have a number of sub-parameters.  The FILESYSTEM, SETUID|NOSETUID, and SECURITY|NOSECURITY sub-parameters have significant security considerations.  FILESYSTEM can be used to specify the name of the MVS HFS data set that holds the logical file system.  Appropriate ACP access rules must be written to protect the named data set.  Update and alter access must be restricted to the z/OS UNIX kernel and to individual systems programming personnel.  The SETUID|NOSETUID sub parameter specifies whether or not the set-user-ID or set group ID permission bits are supported.  SETUID|NOSETUID also impacts the APF authorized and program-controlled extended attributes.  SETUID may be specified for those file systems that contain only vendor-provided software or that have been documented to the IAO as requiring this support.  Otherwise NOSETUID must be specified.  The SECURITY|NOSECURITY sub-parameter specifies whether security checks are performed.  SECURITY must be specified unless a specific exception for the file system has been identified and documented to the IAO.  Regardless of IBM defaults, the values for SETUID|NOSETUID and SECURITY|NOSECURITY must be explicitly coded to protect against potential vendor changes and to simplify security reviews.

Security rules must be defined to prevent unauthorized changes to the z/OS UNIX components in MVS data sets.  Because z/OS UNIX is integrated with the z/OS base control program, many of the z/OS UNIX components reside in data sets that are protected by security definitions specified elsewhere.  The data set names (or masks) unique to z/OS UNIX that may require additional definitions are listed in this section.  Data sets in conventional MVS formats (e.g., PDS) and those in HFS format are listed.  There is also a note on security for user MVS data sets in HFS format.

The following HFS format data sets are unique to z/OS UNIX and require security definitions:

MVS DATA SETS CONTAINING HFS DATA

DATA SET NAME/MASK	MAINTENANCE TYPE

SYS1.OE.ROOT			Target
SYS3.OE.ETCFILES			Target

These data sets should have all access restricted to systems programming personnel and to the z/OS UNIX kernel userid OMVS.  The site may choose different names for these data sets, but the access restrictions must be maintained.

There may be additional data sets that contain system HFS data.  Any data set that specifies a file system that is at the root level (e.g., /tmp, /u) must also have all access restricted to systems programming personnel and to the z/OS UNIX kernel userid.

Depending on the number of users defined in a given z/OS UNIX image, there may be a need to define individual MVS data sets to hold their personal HFS format data.  These data sets must be protected in accordance with the existing security guidelines for user data.  However, there is a need for special additions to those rules.  The z/OS UNIX kernel userid  OMVS must have update access to all user HFS data sets.  Also, users must not have update access to the MVS data sets so that HFS permission controls cannot be altered outside of the z/OS UNIX environment.

These commands are subject to various types of potential abuse. For this reason, it is necessary to place restrictions on the z/OS system commands that can be entered by particular operators.

Some commands are particularly dangerous and should only be used when all less drastic options have been exhausted. Misuse of these commands can create a situation in which the only recovery is an IPL.

Apply the following recommendations when implementing security:

The MVS.** resource is defined to the OPERCMDS class with an access of NONE and all (i.e., failures and successes) access logged.

Access to z/OS system commands defined in the "Required Controls on z/OS System Commands" table in the zOS STIG Addendum is restricted to the appropriate personnel (e.g., operations staff, systems programming personnel, general users).

NOTE:       Use the GROUP category specified in the table referenced above as a guideline to determine appropriate personnel access to system commands.

NOTE:       The (MVS.SEND) Command will not be a finding if used by all.

All access (i.e., failures and successes) to specific z/OS system commands is logged as indicated in the table entitled "Required Controls on z/OS System Commands" in the zOS STIG Addendum.

A sample set of commands to define and permit access to system command resources is shown here:

RDEF OPERCMDS MVS.** UACC(NONE) OWNER(&lt;syspaudt&gt;) AUDIT(ALL(READ)) DATA("set up deny-by-default profile per srr pdi acp00282')

Then, in accordance with the referenced table, use the following template to define profiles for each command:

Do not permit any user or group access to the ** profile.  If a new console is added to the CONSOLxx member of it will be covered by this profile and a subsequent error will display in the log which will allow identification of the undefined console.

The userid associated with each console will have READ access to the corresponding resource defined in the CONSOLE resource class.  A sample command file to accomplish this is shown here:

Rules and requirements for z/OS USS Software Owning Shared Accounts

1) Shall include a statement from the responsible SA requesting the “shared account”, stating specific justification for the z/OS USS Software Owning shared account.  Responsible SA shall be responsible for maintaining all documentation concerning account, usage, control, annual review, etc and shall provide upon request by IA staff or auditors as requested.

2) A separate “z/OS USS Software Owning shared account” userid will be created for each application and/or product that requires USS for separation of duties for product support. This “shared account” shall be used for the sole purpose of file/directory software ownership based upon the UID assigned to the “shared account”.  

3) The “shared accounts” shall only be used within/for USS (UNIX System Services).  The “shared account” userids shall have no special privileges, shall not be granted access to interactive on-line facilities, batch facility, and shall not be granted access to datasets and resources outside of the USS environment.

4) The “shared account” userids shall adhere to the same complex password syntax rules and shall be assigned a non-expiring complex password or be set up as protected under RACF.

5) Authorized user(s) shall only access “shared account” via the USS “SU” Command (switch user: su –s userid ) and not utilize any password.  When the ACP IAO creates the account with a complex password, such password shall not be written down or shared with others.

6) The responsible documented z/OS system programmer shall be granted specific, limited and temporary access based upon submitted security service requests identifying project, duration required and justification for accessing “shared account” via the “su” command on a specific z/OS domain, example: initial software installation or upgrade of specific vendor software.

7) Responsible Individual z/OS System programmer shall be granted temporary access to the specific BPX.SRV.userid  (“userid” shall be the single “shared account” requested) in the surogate user class with full logging of the permission to BPX.SRV.userid for the specific period of time required to perform functional requirements via the “su” command and appropriate usage of the “shared account”.  
8)	Standard procedure for all updates within USS Directories/files shall be performed based upon the direct authority granted to the z/OS system programmer individual userids. Shared accounts shall only be utilized for initial software installation or vendor software upgrades.    

To share HFS or ZFS Files associated with this shared file :

•	Associate the directory or file with a ACP group that has been assigned a z/OS UNIX group identifier (GID), give the ACP group the appropriate group permissions, and connect the users to this ACP group

•	With z/OS Version 1 Release 3 or later, you can use access control lists (ACLs) to control access to files and directories by individual UIDs and GIDs. With ACLs, you can give more than one group permissions for directories or files on HFS, so you do not need to ensure that all your file owners connect to the same ACP group.

NOTE:  If using HFSSEC for TSS or ACF2 you will not be able to use ACLs to control access to your files.

Both CA-ACF2 and CA-TSS provide for a feature and capability to control all HFS/ZFS files and directories directly within the ACP using HFSSEC resource class.  HFSSEC provides full control, auditing and review capability within the native ACP software and requires less interaction in setting up appropriate and proper access controls over the vast USS environment.  With appropriate HFSSEC controls in place, access controls are performed by the ACP and not via USS UID/GID Controls.  Using HFSSEC, all controls are at the userid level and would not be able to utilize ACL’s to control access.

If certificate name filtering is in use, collect documentation describing each active filter rule and written approval from the ISSM to use the rule.

Issue the SETROPTS LIST command. If the DIGTNMAP resource class is active, RACF is ready to process any certificate name filters with a Status of TRUST. The DIGTNMAP resource class should not be active unless certificate name filtering is desired.

If the DIGTNMAP resource class is not active, there is NO FINDING.

Certificate name filters are stored as profiles in the DIGTNMAP resource class. The RLIST command is not intended for use with profiles in the DIGTNMAP resource class. However it can be used to determine if any profiles are defined. (NOTE: The information will not be displayed in a suitable format to easily interpret the filter.) 

RLIST DIGTNMAP *

If there is nothing to list in the DIGTNMAP resource class, there is NO FINDING.

If profile information is displayed, one or more certificate name filters are defined to RACF. Under the NAME heading of each profile listing is the userid the filter is being mapped to. Issue the following command the list the certificate name filter associated with each userid:

HostKeyRingLabel="SSHDAEM/SSHDring my label"
</fixtext><fix id="F-75867r1_fix" /><check system="C-70111r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_zOS RACF STIG.xml" /><check-content>Locate the SSH daemon configuration file. 
May be found in /etc/ssh/ directory.
Alternately:
From UNIX System Services ISPF Shell navigate to ribbon select tools.
Select option 1 - Work with Processes.

If SSH Daemon is not active there is no finding.

Examine the file.
Ensure the following are either not coded or commented out:
	#HostKey for protocol version 1 
	#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key 
	#HostKeys for protocol version 2 
	#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key 
	#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key 

Locate the z/OS-specific sshd server system-wide configuration file.
zos_sshd_config

May be found in /etc/ssh/ directory.

Ensure that a HostKeyRingLabel line is coded and not commented out.

If either of the above is not true this is a finding.
