The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. 

ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary and access control mechanisms are required.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target F5 BIG-IP LTM 11.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>F5 BIG-IP LTM 11.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2843</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-000213</ident><fixtext fixref="F-65871r1_fix">If user access control intermediary services are provided, configure the BIG-IP Core as follows:

Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but being transported to an unapproved destination.

ALGs enforce approved authorizations by employing security policy and/or rules that restrict information system services, provide packet-filtering capability based on header or protocol information, and/or message filtering capability based on data content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target F5 BIG-IP LTM 11.x</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>F5 BIG-IP LTM 11.x</dc:subject><dc:identifier>2843</dc:identifier></reference><ident system="http://iase.disa.mil/cci">CCI-001368</ident><fixtext fixref="F-65873r1_fix">If user packet-filtering intermediary services are provided, configure the BIG-IP Core as follows:

The ALG is installed and configured in such a way that it restricts or blocks information flows based on guidance in the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) regarding restrictions for boundary crossing for ports, protocols and services.

These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

The primary function of an ALG is to provide application-specific content filtering and/or proxy services.

ALGs are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. DoD continually assesses the ports, protocols, and services that can be used for network communications. Some ports, protocols, or services have known exploits or security weaknesses. Network traffic using these ports, protocols, and services must be prohibited or restricted in accordance with DoD policy. The ALG is a key network element for preventing these non-compliant ports, protocols, and services from causing harm to DoD information systems.

The network ALG must be configured to prevent or restrict the use of prohibited ports, protocols, and services throughout the network by filtering the network traffic and disallowing or redirecting traffic as necessary. Default and updated policy filters from the vendors will disallow older versions of protocols and applications and will address most known non-secure ports, protocols, and/or services.

Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

Network devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

This requirement applies to gateways and firewalls that perform content inspection or have higher-layer proxy functionality.

Note: A limitation of ~200 policies per cluster currently exists on the BIG-IP Core.
