MGCP is a clear text human readable protocol. This information is critical in the setup and completion of voice calls from one VoIP zone to another VoIP zone or more typically from a VoIP zone to a TDM zone. If this information is poisoned or if collected and used by an unauthorized unscrupulous individual, the effects to the VoIP environment could be detrimental. Denial-of-service or fraudulent system use are only two of the potential compromises. As such, MGCP messages must be protected from eavesdropping, man in the middle, and replay attacks. To protect MGCP, Request for Comment (RFC) 2705 which defines MGCP outlines and recommends the use of IPSec for encryption and authentication between gateways. This recommendation primarily applies to the use of MGCP across unprotected WANs like the Internet. This extends to use on NIPRNet as well. A follow-on protocol defined jointly by the IETF in RFC 3435 and the ITU-T in Recommendation H.248.1 is MEGACO/H.248 which provides the same general functionality as MGCP.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;VoIP networks increasingly represent high-value targets for attacks and represent a greater risk to network security than most other network applications; hence, it is imperative that the voice network and supporting data network(s) be secured as tightly as possible to reduce the impact that an attack can have on either network(s). Segregating voice traffic from data traffic greatly enhances the security and availability of all services. Further subdivision of the voice and data networks can further enhance security. Achieving the ideal security posture for voice and data would require two physically separate and distinct networks (including cable plant), much as is the case with traditional voice and data technologies. Although this might be considered for the most demanding security environments, it works against the idea of convergence and the associated cost savings expected by having one network (and cable plant). Logical segregation of VoIP components and data components can be accomplished at both layer 2 using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and layer 3 using IP addressing. While these methods, in themselves, are not designed as security mechanisms, they do provide a derived security benefit by easing management of filtering rules and obfuscating or hiding addresses and information that an attacker could use to facilitate an attack. Separation may also prevent an attack on one network from impacting the other. These methods make it harder for an attacker to be successful and help to provide a layered approach to VoIP and network security. Segregating data from telephony by placing VoIP servers and subscriber terminals on logically separate IP networks and logically separate Ethernet networks while controlling access to these VoIP components through filters will help to ensure security and aid in protecting the VoIP environment from external threats. In addition, further subdivision of those components is necessary to protect the telephony applications which are running across the infrastructure. Layer 3 address segregation is the first layer in our layered defense approach to VoIP security. It allows the use of switches, routers, and firewalls with their associated access lists and other processes, to control traffic between the components on the network. To provide address segregation, best practices dictate that all like components will be placed in like address ranges. Therefore VoIP components (i.e., Gatekeepers, Call Managers, voice mail systems, IP Subscriber Terminals etc.) will be deployed within their own, separate private IP network, logical sub-network, or networks. The combination of logical data and voice segmentation via addressing and VLANs coupled with a switched and routed infrastructure strongly mitigates call eavesdropping and other attacks. In addition, limiting logical access to VoIP components is necessary for protecting telephony applications running across the infrastructure. Segregating data from telephony by placing VoIP servers and subscriber terminals on logically separate IP networks while controlling access to these VoIP components through IP filters will help to ensure security and aid in protecting the VoIP environment. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Access to the VVoIP infrastructure or endpoints leading to unauthorized access, denial-of-service, compromise of communications confidentiality or integrity.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, DCPA-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-7710r1_fix">Implement VoIP systems and components on a logically segregated and dedicated telephony (VoIP) network.</fixtext><fixtext fixref="F-20236r1_fix">Ensure a different, dedicated, address blocks or ranges are defined for the VVoIP system within the LAN (Enclave) that is separate from the address blocks/ranges used by the rest of the LAN for non VVoIP system devices thus allowing traffic and access control using firewalls and router ACLs.

Guidelines and requirements for securing access layer devices including any associated cross-connect hardware can be found in the Network Infrastructure STIG. Layer 2 network segregation is the second layer in our layered defense approach to VoIP security. Voice traffic must be isolated from data traffic using separate physical LANs or Virtual LANs. The combination of data and voice segregation and segmentation using VLANs along with a switched infrastructure strongly enhances the security posture of the system. This will also help to mitigate call eavesdropping and other attacks. VLAN technology has traditionally been an efficient way of grouping users into workgroups to share a specific network address space and broadcast domain regardless of their physical location on the network. Hosts within the same VLAN can communicate with other hosts in the same VLAN using layer-2 switching. To communicate with other VLANs, traffic must go through a layer 3 device where it can be filtered and routed. VLANs can offer significant benefits in a multi-service network by providing a convenient way of isolating VVoIP equipment and traffic from the data equipment and traffic. When VLANs are deployed, excessive broadcast and multicast packets present in the normal data traffic will not disrupt IPT services. As with data networks, IPT equipment and instruments should be logically grouped using multiple VLANs such that IP Phones share their VLANs only with other IP Phones, gateways with like gateways, and so on. Each type of VVoIP device would have mutually exclusive VLANs. This forces layer 3 routing and thereby enables all the filtering capabilities of the layer 3 devices. Additionally, each server type should have its own VLAN. Private server VLANs would prevent a compromised server from attacking another server on the same VLAN at layer two. Since all the devices on any given VLAN would have the same Layer 2 though 4 (at least) characteristics the filtering rules become easier to develop, deploy, and manage. Additionally, the implementation of VLANs helps to mitigate the risk of attacks sourced from the data VLANs such as virus driven DoS attack or packet sniffing. In addition, placing voice and data traffic into separate VLANs will reduce competition for the network and thus reduce latency (queue/wait time) for transmission services, which will reduce the possibility of denial of voice services. This also reduces the Ethernet broadcast domain thereby reducing network overhead. Since VoIP is very latency sensitive this segmentation approach is the most economical way to improve performance in an existing network infrastructure. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;This finding can be reduced to a cat III in the event the system minimally implements one VLAN for endpoints and one for the core equipment.

This may not be a finding under certain circumstances such as in the case of a small footprint tactical system where there is a limited number of VoIP instruments (i.e., 20). This package system must have been accredited via the appropriate test exercises and configured in accordance with the accreditation. This override is partially driven by the difficulty in supporting a complex configuration for these small systems in deployed environments. This Severity Override does not apply to strategic systems (i.e., systems implemented on a base or fixed DOD facility) or large relatively fixed tactical deployments.

NOTE: Hardware based VTC endpoints that utilize LSC services for session control may reside in the VoIP endpoint VLAN(s). These may include desktop and “executive” or office based units. All other Hardware based VTC endpoints require their own dedicated network or VLAN. 
 
NOTE: Separate VLANs work in conjunction with the dedicated address space discussed earlier to provide the required effect. Each VLAN is configured with a subset of addresses (valid IP subnet) from the designated VVoIP address space
NOTE: Per NI STIG requirements the NE’s default VLAN (VLAN 0 or 1) will not be used for any of the required VVoIP, data, or VTC VLANs.

NOTE: ACLs are required between the various VLANs that will filter traffic between them based on what protocols and IP addresses are permitted to access or control the device(s) residing in the VLAN. Therefore it is expected that the LAN / VVoIP system design will include one or more routers or layer-3 switches as the intersection of all of these VLANs to access and traffic flow between them. This routing device will be configured with ACLs to only permit the functionally necessary traffic to flow between the various VLANs and the equipment they contain.

This is a finding in the event the design or implementation of the VVoIP system and supporting LAN does not include the required VLANs and subnets based upon the equipment and services provided by or included in the VVoIP system. Size of the system or the number of users supported has no effect on the need for this segmentation. However under some circumstances such as in the case of a small deployable package the number of VLANs can be reduced based upon a benefit vs. risk assessment, DAA approval, and package C&amp;A.

NOTE: The existence of the required VLANs will be validated in subsequent computing checks. The purpose of this check is to determine if the system design and implementation plan includes consideration for VLAN segmentation.

Information gleaned from signaling messages can be used to attack the system or for other nefarious reasons. If VVoIP traffic is passed in the clear it is open to sniffing attacks. This vulnerability exists whether the traffic is on a LAN/CAN or a MAN/WAN. Native end-to-end encryption of the signaling and media mitigates this vulnerability. As a secondary solution, mitigation can be accomplished at the link-level through the incorporation of encrypted VPN tunneling technology. Both solutions are applicable when the communicating endpoints are operated by the same organization or they reside in enclaves operated by the same organization and the endpoints and supporting systems are interoperable. As such, encryption of some approved form is required to protect DoD-to-DoD communications across a public network such as the Internet or a publicly accessible network such as the NIPRNet.

While end-to-end application or protocol level encryption is preferred, tunneling unencrypted VVOIP signaling and media traffic using approved commercial grade (Type 3) site-to-site or client-to-site (remote access) VPN technologies mitigates the risk. The inherent type 1 site-to-site encryption employed afforded classified networks, such as the SIPRNet, also meets this requirement, although such networks are not public or publicly accessible as a rule.

DoD-to-DoD voice communications are generally considered to contain sensitive information. Local DoD enclaves connect to a DISN SDN via an access circuit. Unless the site is a host to a SDN, or close enough to it to be served by DoD owned facilities, some portion of the access circuit will utilize leased commercial facilities.

For example, a legacy voice mail platform can connect to a VoIP gateway to provide voice mail services for VoIP users. In the same respect, a VoIP based voice mail platform can provide voice mail services to the legacy voice users and the VoIP users. In addition to providing traditional voice mail services, many VoIP voice mail systems are also capable of providing unified mail (integrated voice and electronic mail), or by interacting with existing email messaging systems.

Steps should be taken to ensure that these operating systems are secured in accordance to the appropriate STIG. Application services supporting the voice mail services should also be hardened. For example, MS SQL Server may be used to support subscriber accounts, or MS IIS may be used to allow subscribers to change their voice mail settings using an Internet Browser. Various VoIP solutions use various application services to provide Voice and voice mail support. Many of these applications can provide access to the VoIP environment via unsecured channels.

All unused services are to be disabled and all application servers are to be secured using the applicable STIG guidance. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.

Control commands are dialed using the keypad and transmitted using Dial-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) audio tones. The voice greetings are transmitted using normal audio as well. The audio can be analog or digital, which is encoded in whatever coding scheme is used by the local PBX. In IP based phone systems access to the voicemail server carries the same vulnerabilities as the IP voice communications carried by the system. As such access to voicemail for the purpose of creating greeting messages, retrieving voicemail, or adjusting personal settings, must be encrypted on the IP network. In part this is because anyone with a sniffer and access to the right LAN segment can acquire the subscriber’s account and password information. With this intercepted information a hacker could gain access to the subscribers voice mail account, intercept sensitive information, and/or perform other destructive actions. Once access to settings is achieved there the intruder could change greetings or possibly forward all voicemails received.

Encryption of the voice message traffic as well as control from the phone’s dial-pad falls under the normal requirement for the encryption of VoIP signaling and media.

In the event the subscriber’s personal settings are accessible via a “web” connection using a browser on the subscriber’s desktop or phone, the connection must use HTTPS and TLS minimally to protect the user’s logon credentials. Additionally, the voicemail system/server, which provides this service via a web server application, must be configured in accordance with the “private web server” requirements in the Web Server STIG/Checklist.

Many government entities are exploring mobile communication solutions that include wireless VoIP that can meet critical needs for interoperability and flexibility. This will soon expand to video and unified communications over wireless. IP based wireless voice services and devices (endpoints) initially used Wi-Fi (802.11(x)) wireless LAN (WLAN) technologies. These devices are still available today and are essentially a cordless phone that happens to use Wi-Fi. Today vendors are integrating 802.11(x) VoIP capabilities into cellular phones that can transition seamlessly between a cellular network and a WLAN. This means that a user can place a call using the WLAN in their office and then move out of range and transition to their cellular carrier’s network without losing the call. Such a transition can operate in the other direction as well. Other devices integrate Cellular and Wi-Fi with WiMAX (802.11(e)) capabilities providing similar transitions as well as enterprise grade presence, messaging, directories, email, etc. Additionally, SmartPhones can support VoIP softphone applications which utilize the smartphone’s native IP connectivity. Similarly SmartPhone supported connectivity can be over cellular, Wi-Fi, and/or WiMAX network. Using these capabilities over wireless technologies presents vulnerabilities to the communications carried and the VVoIP infrastructure. Confidentiality is one of the greatest concerns requiring encryption of the media and signaling as it is on a wired MAN/WAN or LAN per the VoIP STIG/Checklist but even more so. This encryption is in addition to the WLAN encryption required by the Wireless STIG/Checklist. Additionally, per the Wireless STIG/Checklist, the endpoints must authenticate to the WLAN before being granted access thus preventing rogue endpoints and other devices from accessing the network, while the endpoint must also register with the VVoIP controllers. Another great concern for using wireless VVoIP communications services is reliability and availability when using the technology for critical C2 communications. Being wireless, all of the usual issues with radio transmission and reception come into play. In the event a C2 call is initiated, it could be blocked at either the transmitting end or the receiving end. This could be because the spectrum or channels could be busy/overloaded, unavailable, or deliberately jammed by an adversary. As such, VVoIP services should not be relied upon for C2 communications. NOTE: If Wireless VoIP technology is deployed all the requirements in the VoIP STIG/Checklist as well as those contained in the Wireless STIG/Checklist are to be applied to the wireless VoIP environment. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECSC-1, ECWN-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-7739r1_fix">Apply requirements contained in both the VoIP STIG and the Wireless STIG wherever VoIP over Wireless is used.</fixtext><fixtext fixref="F-20139r1_fix">In the event IP based VVoIP (V-V) services are used over a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi 802.11x) or Wireless MAN (WiMAX 802.16) connection, Ensure the applicable endpoint and service related requirements contained in the Wireless STIG/Checklist have been applied to the wireless VVoIP service and endpoints in addition to the applicable VoIP STIG/Checklist requirements.

Secure wireless VVoIP services and endpoints in accordance with the Wireless STIG/Checklist as well as the VoIP STIG/Checklist. 

The areas of primary concern are, but are not limited to the following:
&gt; Is the endpoint an approved endpoint?
&gt; Is the endpoint configured to support the required VoIP endpoint, registration, authentication, and media/signaling encryption requirements? 
&gt; Is the endpoint configured to support the required WLAN access control, authentication, and encryption requirements?

However, the endpoints could also be desk phones and some could also support Bluetooth headsets, which are also covered in the Wireless STIG/Checklist.
NOTE: Wireless VVoIP service relates to the conveyance of the V-V traffic over the wireless LAN/MAN including related requirements for encryption and endpoint authentication. This requirement does not relate directly to the VVoIP infrastructure connected to a wired LAN that also happens to be using wireless transport.

This makes it difficult for someone to add unauthorized digital instruments to the system. This, however, could be done easier with older analog systems by tapping an existing analog line. With VoIP, this is no longer the case. Most IPT/VoIP systems employ an automatic means of detecting and registering a new instrument on the network with the call management server and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. This presents a vulnerability whereby unauthorized instruments could be added to the system or instruments could be moved without authorization. Such activity can happen anywhere there is an active network port or outlet. This is not only a configuration management problem, but it could also allow theft of services or some other malicious attack. It is recognized however, that auto-registration is necessary during large deployments of VoIP terminals, as well as a short time thereafter, to facilitate additions and troubleshooting. This applies to initial system setup and to any subsequent large redeployments or additions. Normal, day to day, “moves, adds, and changes” will require manual registration. Since, it may be possible for an unauthorized VoIP terminal to easily be added to the system during auto-registration, the registration logs must be compared to the authorized terminal inventory. Alternately the system could have a method of automatically registering only pre-authorized terminals. This feature would support VoIP terminals that are DAA approved for connection from multiple local or remote locations. It is critical to the security of the system that all IPT /VoIP end instruments be authorized to connect to and use the system. Only authorized instruments should be configured in the system controller and therefore allowed to operate. Unauthorized instruments could lead to system compromise or abuse. A manual inventory of authorized end instruments will aid in the detection of unauthorized instruments registered to the system particularly during the period when auto-detection/registration is permitted. This will also aid in C&amp;A efforts. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Unauthorized use or abuse of the system&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20141r1_fix">Ensure that an inventory of authorized instruments is documented and maintained.

Prepare and maintain an inventory / database of authorized VoIP instruments. Generate and store the inventory on a separate workstation or server from the LSC (for example, the LSC management workstation).

This is most easily and safely accomplished by providing a DHCP server that is dedicated to the VVoIP system endpoints. That is to say that a DHCP server serving VVoIP devices needs to be in the VVoIP domain i.e., same address space and VLAN(s). This alleviates the need to route DHCP requests into the data environment on the LAN which would degrade the separation of the VVoIP environment and the Data environment. 

NOTE: In the event a dedicated DHCP server for VVoIP endpoints is not implemented, the network (i.e., the router controlling access to and from the VVoIP endpoint VLANs) must route VVoIP endpoint DHCP requests directly to the DHCP server in such a manner that prevents traffic to flow between the VVoIP and data VLANs. Additionally the DHCP server must prevent such traffic flows while providing the VVoIP endpoints with proper VVoIP addresses and other information within the VVoIP address/subnet range (scope).

NOTE: The best practice for endpoint address assignment is to manually assign addresses when authorizing the instrument by generating its configuration file.

NOTE: This is applicable to the following: &gt; A classified LAN connected to a classified WAN (such as the SIPRNet). 

NOTE: In the case of a classified WAN where network wide address based accountability or traceability is required by the network PMO, the PMO must provide a segregated, network wide address block(s) so that the attached classified LANs can meet this requirement. DISA provides a world wide VoIP based voice communications service called the DISN Voice over Secret IP (VoSIP) service or just VoSIP for short. This service is managed by the DRSN PMO. This service also provides gateways into the DRSN. In support of the above requirement, the SIPRNet PMO has designated specific dedicated address ranges for use by the DISN VoSIP service and assigned these address blocks to the DRSN/VoSIP PMO for VoSIP address management and assignment. The VoSIP service provides VoIP based communications between VoIP systems within customer’s classified LANs (C-LANs) operating at the secret level while using the SIPRNet WAN for the inter-enclave (inter-LAN) transport. Additionally, the SIPRNet PMO requires network wide address based accountability or traceability based on assigned IP address. As such customer’s SIPRNet connected secret C-LANs utilize addresses assigned by the SIPRNet PMO. Therefore, customers of the DISN VoSIP service must use IP addresses assigned to them by the DRSN/VoSIP PMO when addressing the VoIP controllers and endpoints within their C-LANs. This is to maintain the segregation of the Voice and data environments on the customer’s secret C-LANs as required by this STIG. This also facilitates proper routing and flow control over the traffic between VoSIP addresses. 

NOTE: the DISN service is designated DISN Voice over Secret IP but uses an acronym (VoSIP) which also means Voice over Secure IP. Voice over Secure IP relates to any VoIP based service on a secure or classified IP network. 

NOTE: While the DISN VoSIP service is the preferred means to interconnect SIPRNet connected secret C-LANs for VoIP service, it is recognized that there may be a need for an organization to implement a VoIP based voice or video communications system within their organization or with close partners. In the event such a system has no need or potential need to communicate with other enclaves that use the DISN VoSIP service, they must utilize their own dedicated IP address space carved out of the address space assigned to their C-LANs by the SIPRNet PMO in accordance with the previously noted requirement.

These requirements are defined in the current CJCSI 6215.01x Policy for DoD Voice Networks With Real Time Services (RTS). Design requirements for networks supporting DOD IPT/VoIP implementations can be found in the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) specification document. This document contains the design specifications for an Assured Services Local Area Network (ASLAN) which is required to support DOD IP based voice services. These specifications define LAN design requirements for redundancy of equipment and their interconnections as well as minimum requirements for bandwidth and backup power, including the maximum number of endpoints that can be affected by a single point of failure. Policy sets the minimum requirements for the availability and reliability of VVoIP  systems and the supporting LAN with emphasis on C2 communications. Policy excerpts are as follows: From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 (c) Availability requirements for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2 users is 0.999. From UCR 5.3.1.7.6 Availability LAN [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] The ASLAN has two configurations depending on whether it supports special C2 or C2 users. The ASLAN shall have a hardware availability designed to meet the needs of its subscribers: 1. Special C2. An ASLAN that supports special C2 users is classified a High Availability ASLAN and must meet 99.999 percent availability to include scheduled maintenance. 2. C2. An ASLAN that supports C2 users is classified as a Medium Availability ASLAN and must have 99.997 percent availability to include scheduled maintenance. [Required: Non-ASLAN] The non-ASLAN shall provide an availability of 99.9 percent to include scheduled maintenance. From UCR 5.3.1.7.7 Redundancy [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] The ASLAN shall have no single point of failure that can cause an outage of more than 96 IP telephony subscribers. In order to meet the availability requirements, all switching/routing platforms that offer service to more than 96 telephony subscribers shall provide redundancy in either of two ways: 1. The product itself (Core, Distribution, or Access) provides redundancy internally. 2. A secondary product is added to the ASLAN to provide redundancy to the primary product.

This is a finding in the event the LAN is not designed as an ASLAN in support of its C2 and Special-C2 user’s availability and reliability requirements. The following is a list of the areas to be addressed by the design (validation will be addressed later):

Specific attention should be given in the areas of:
- Equipment reliability and redundancy 
- Connection redundancy above the access layer
- Equipment robustness and bandwidth capability
- Connection bandwidth capability
- Access layer switch size / number of phones served 
- Single points of failure affecting service to greater than 96 instruments.
- Backup power for all equipment. 
&gt;&gt; 2 hours for all equipment and instruments supporting C2 users
&gt;&gt; 8 hours for all equipment and instruments supporting Special-C2 users

Specific requirements or deficiencies will be investigated in subsequent checklist items.

NOTE: The primary difference between this requirement and the general requirement checked earlier is that the availability and reliability requirements in support of C2 and Special-C2 users are higher than C2R, Non C2, and administrative users.

This port is typically called a “PC Port”. This is done so that a can share a single network cable drop and LAN access switchport. The PC port can, in general, support any device requiring an Ethernet connection. In theory, a VoIP phone, a desktop VTC unit, and a workstation could be daisy chained on a single LAN drop. These PC ports are supported by an embedded three port Ethernet switch or a hub. Hubs cannot support VLANs and therefore cannot be used to daisy chain VVoIP endpoints and non VVoIP devices in DoD networks. A switch must be used because the VVoIP or VTC endpoint must be capable of maintaining the separation of the voice (VVoIP), data, VLANs as well as the VTC VLAN and PC Comm Client VLAN if present. For example the attached PC must not be able to directly access the phone’s or VTU’s configurations or communications traffic. VAN separation helps to prevent this. NOTE: the switch or endpoint will typically utilize 802.1Q trunking (VLAN tagging) but may use some other means to separate voice and data traffic. Typically when 802.1Q VLAN tagging is used, the phone firmware tags the VoIP packets while the embedded switch passes all packets without modification. This permits devices connected to the PC port to tag their packets and assign the proper VLAN to their traffic type. 802.1Q VLAN tagging enables the LAN to better maintain separation of the traffic and is therefore the preferred method. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;VVoIP 5700 &lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.

This control is implemented through the use of a properly designed set of ACLs on the LANs routing device(s) (router or layer-3 switch(s) capable of implementing ACLs) for each of the defined VLAN/subnets implemented. This requirement defines the ACLs that manage the flow of traffic between the various VVoIP VLAN/subnets. As a refresher, the VLAN/subnets are defined as follows: &gt; Hardware Endpoints: multiple VLAN/subnets generally in parallel with data LAN VLANs the number of which is dependant on the size of the LAN and as required for the reduction of broadcast domains per good LAN design. For small networks there will be a minimum of one. &gt; Software endpoints on workstations: multiples as with hardware endpoints. &gt; VVoIP system core control equipment containing the LSC, endpoint configuration server, and DHCP server if used, etc &gt; VVoIP system management VLAN which is separate from the general LAN management VLAN &gt; Media gateways to the DSN and PSTN &gt; Signaling gateways (SG) to the DSN &gt; DoD WAN access VVoIP firewall (EBC)  &gt; Voicemail / Unified Messaging Servers. These may need to be accessible from both the voice and data VLANs. &gt; UC servers such as those supporting IM/presence, “web” browser based conferencing, and directory services. These may need to be accessible from both the voice and data VLANs. NOTE: The VLAN/subnets and associated ACLs need only to be assigned / applied for devices that exist in the VVoIP system. The VLAN / ACL design may change depending upon the location and physical makeup of the VVoIP core equipment. An example of this is if a MG and SG reside on the same platform and both use the same Ethernet LAN connection(s) (and potentially the same or different IP address(s)), then separate VLANs are not needed for the MG and SG but the ACL protecting them may need to be adjusted accordingly. In general the defined ACLs are designed in a deny-by-default manner such that only the protocols and traffic that needs to reach the device or devices in the VLAN receive the packets. The ACLs filter on VLAN, IP address / subnet, protocol type, and associated standard IP port for the protocol. In general the ACLs mentioned are egress filters (referenced the router core) on the VLAN interfaces. Additionally, the routing devices should log and alarm on inappropriate traffic. An example of this is an HTTP request sourced from the data VLAN(s) to the endpoint or media gateway VLAN(s). The primary purpose of ACL on all VVoIP VLAN interface(s) is to block traffic to/from the data VLAN interface(s).

This control is implemented through the use of a properly designed set of ACLs on the LANs routing device(s) (router or layer-3 switch(s) capable of implementing ACLs) for each of the defined VLAN/subnets implemented. This requirement defines the ACLs that manage the flow of traffic between the various VVoIP VLAN/subnets. As a refresher, the VLAN/subnets are defined as follows: &gt; Hardware Endpoints: multiple VLAN/subnets generally in parallel with data LAN VLANs the number of which is dependant on the size of the LAN and as required for the reduction of broadcast domains per good LAN design. For small networks there will be a minimum of one. &gt; Software endpoints on workstations: multiples as with hardware endpoints. &gt; VVoIP system core control equipment containing the LSC, endpoint configuration server, and DHCP server if used, etc &gt; VVoIP system management VLAN which is separate from the general LAN management VLAN &gt; Media gateways to the DSN and PSTN &gt; Signaling gateways (SG) to the DSN &gt; DoD WAN access VVoIP firewall (EBC)  &gt; Voicemail / Unified Messaging Servers. These may need to be accessible from both the voice and data VLANs. &gt; UC servers such as those supporting IM/presence, “web” browser based conferencing, and directory services. These may need to be accessible from both the voice and data VLANs. NOTE: The VLAN/subnets and associated ACLs need only to be assigned / applied for devices that exist in the VVoIP system. The VLAN / ACL design may change depending upon the location and physical makeup of the VVoIP core equipment. An example of this is if a MG and SG reside on the same platform and both use the same Ethernet LAN connection(s) (and potentially the same or different IP address(s)), then separate VLANs are not needed for the MG and SG but the ACL protecting them may need to be adjusted accordingly. In general the defined ACLs are designed in a deny-by-default manner such that only the protocols and traffic that needs to reach the device or devices in the VLAN receive the packets.

The typical firewall used to protect an enclave that supports normal data traffic is not capable of properly handling or supporting real time communications (VVoIP). The following paragraphs will demonstrate this. VVoIP uses a signaling protocol and a media transfer protocol that require both inbound and outbound permissions be set for these protocols in order to provide the capability to place and receive calls to/from endpoints outside the enclave. More specifically, the signaling protocol typically uses one or more static TCP ports that must be open inbound at all times to receive calls. The media protocol; Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP) and its companion protocol Real-time Transfer Control Protocol (RTCP) utilize randomly assigned UDP ports in the potential range of 1025-65535 with four IP ports required for every bi-directional voice session/call. The number of ports is expanded if video is added. The typical method of supporting VoIP through a standard data firewall is to open (or permit inbound) the signaling IP port(s) and a wide range of UDP ports for the RTP/RTCP media streams. While a typical data firewall can provide some protection from a VoIP implementation if the inbound permit statements are limited to specific limited address ranges (applicable in some situations), this is not possible if calls are to be permitted from any IP address on the Internet or NIPRNet that could be located anywhere in the world. Address segregation for VVoIP is generally not possible since the NIPRNet address space is disjointed (chopped up) and is spread across the overall public Internet (IPv4) address space. To support a worldwide IP enabled DSN, a typical data firewall would need to permit VVoIP signaling and media inbound from the entire registered IPv4 address space. One reason why this is the case is that an ACL developed to limit inbound enclave access to permit only NIPRNet addresses would require many permit statements such that the ACL itself could degrade firewall or router performance. As such, permitting VVoIP traffic across a standard data firewall opens gaping holes in the enclave’s perimeter protection. This is of particular concern when the WAN is the Internet or a DISN service that provides connection to the INTERNET such as the NIPRNet. On the other hand, a standard data firewall poses problems for VVoIP call/session completion if external public addressing is used with internal private (RFC 1918) addressing which requires the firewall to do NAT/NAPT. This is because the VVoIP endpoints need to know the IP address of the other endpoint and they signal their address within the signaling messages. The firewall changes the IP address of the packet during the NAT but does not change it in the signaling message causing a mismatch. The effect is that the call/session cannot be completed. NOTE: If the WAN is a “closed” system where the entire address space of the WAN and connected enclaves is managed by a “single system manager” (as is the case with DISN classified networks) a specific limited and segregated address space can be assigned for all VVoIP devices for use across the entire network. In this case, the risk to the enclave can be limited (although not eliminated) if a standard firewall is used with inbound permit statements that are based on the segregated IP address range. This protection can be further enhanced by limiting the UDP port range. An allowance has been made for such a situation; however, this may change in the future. Based on the above, If VVoIP is to traverse the enclave boundary; the firewall must be VVoIP aware or capable. A VVoIP aware/capable firewall provides the following minimal functions. &gt; Interprets and understands the signaling protocol to determine the UDP ports that are negotiated for the RTP/RTCP media streams. &gt; Dynamically opens the required UDP ports to permit the flow of the media (audio and video). &gt; Performs stateful inspection on the UDP media packets to ensure the packets are part of the active call/session, while dropping all non session packets. &gt; Closes the UDP ports when the end of the call/session is signaled OR after a period of session inactivity. In the event NAT is used across the enclave boundary, the VVoIP aware/capable firewall provides the following NAT functions: &gt; Interprets and understands the signaling protocol to determine the IP addresses that are negotiated between the endpoints and adjusts the signaling messages in accordance with the local NAT/NAPT internal and external addresses. &gt; Performs the NAT/NAPT address changes on the RTP/RTCP media packets as they traverse the boundary. In the event, the VVoIP enclave boundary provides access to and interoperability with a DISN IP based assured service voice service (such as the IP-DSN on NIPRNet), VVoIP aware/capable firewall must provide the following additional functions (Note: these are defined in the UCR): &gt; Provides encryption services for the signaling protocol (AS-SIP uses TLS) &gt; Provides authentication of the source of the signaling protocol packets and drops all unauthenticated packets. &gt; Provides integrity validation of the signaling protocol packets and drops all invalid or modified packets. &gt; Terminates the AS-SIP signaling session and checks the validity of the AS-SIP messages based on content and establishes a new signaling session for the next hop, thus performing an application level inspection of the signaling messages. &gt; Communicates with Call controllers (LSCs and MFSSs) using AS-SIP/TLS &gt; Interprets and understands the AS-SIP signaling protocol to provide the minimal and NAT functions noted above &gt; Supports encrypted RTP/RTSP media streams. That is SRTP/SRTCP &gt; Provides the capability to decrypt the media streams for inspection and recording. This supports monitoring/recording for CALEA and COMSEC monitoring purposes for calls that traverse the enclave boundary. &gt; Performs intrusion and DoS detection with alarm capability for both the signaling and media. &gt; Blocks all non VVoIP traffic whether destined for the VVoIP or data sub-enclaves. NOTE: While RTCP messages could be validated for content and format, the contents of RTP packets cannot due to the random nature of the audio and video data being transmitted. Delaying the RTCP packets for inspection or the SRTCP messages for decryption and inspection while passing the RTP/SRTP packets would cause disruption in the media flow and thereby negatively affect its quality. Additionally, the delay of the SRTP packets for decryption and inspection would have similar effects. Thus intrusion detection based on the media streams is almost impossible since attack profiles are generally unavailable. Based on this and to improve worldwide voice quality, the DSN/RTS PMO and the RTS WG has determined that the SRTP/SRTCP streams will be passed by the VVoIP firewall without inspecting the encrypted contents of the packets. NOTE: The VVoIP aware/capable firewall discussed here defines a set of functions that are unique to a VVoIP which are different from the set of functions required for data firewalls. The functions for data firewalls are defined in the Network Infrastructure STIG. While typically a single firewall will not be capable of supporting both sets of functions (which means a separate VVoIP firewall is needed in parallel to the data firewall) this requirement does not mean that a dedicated VVoIP firewall must be implemented in the event a single firewall is capable of implementing both sets of functions simultaneously. The primary task of the data firewall function is to protect the entire enclave. In doing so, it must perform its normal function of protecting the data sub-enclave while also blocking all VVoIP traffic destined for it via the data firewall. An exception could be made for this on a case by case basis if permissions are limited in scope as would be the case for VTC. All data traffic/protocols destined for the VVoIP sub-enclave must also be blocked unless specifically authorized to meet a mission need. Such a mission need might be for remote management of the VVoIP system from a NOC or user-to-site VPN, however, this traffic must would be routed to the VVoIP management VLAN(s) and not the VVoIP production VLANs. An additional consideration for passing VoIP across an enclave boundary is when there are different vendor’s VoIP systems deployed within the different enclaves connected to the WAN, and the various vendor’s systems are not interoperable or do not provide assured service outside the enclave, or the WAN cannot support QoS and assured service. In this case, interoperability and assured service must be preserved across the DSN or DISN voice network, whether traditional TDM or VoIP. Therefore, the VoIP system must connect to other enclaves via a traditional TDM based long haul network. Such a connection is made using a media gateway. Therefore, if the enclave VoIP system is not compatible with the IP enabled DSN as defined in the UCR thereby providing interoperability and assured service end-to-end across the DISN voice network, the system must employ a media gateway and connect to a traditional DSN switch. Additionally, unless specific requirements (discussed later) are met, all connections to the PSTN must be via a media gateway and an appropriate trunk (PRI or CAS). &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;The enclave boundary protection is bypassed or degraded permitting unauthorized access to the LAN / Enclave.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;EBBD-1, EBBD-2, EBBD-3, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20286r1_fix">In the event a VVoIP/UC system is deployed/implemented within the enclave AND the enclave accesses external networks, ensure the enclave’s connection to external networks is designed to maintain the required enclave boundary protection for both the data and voice/video sub-enclaves as well as separation within the LAN and to support interoperability between different vendor’s VVoIP/UC systems implemented in different enclaves.

The network IDS inspects all NON-VVoIP traffic to/from the VVoIP management VLANs that is specifically required for management of the VVoIP system. (Except if there is an alternate data perimeter implemented for this purpose). 

&gt; The VVoIP firewall function provides protection for the VVoIP sub-enclave and the data sub-enclave as follows:

NOTE: A good indication is whether or not the VVoIP firewall is listed on the DoD UC APL found at http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/apl/index.html.

These  reasons are as follows: 
&gt; VVoIP has the potential to significantly degrade the standard data enclave boundary protection afforded by the required data enclave firewall unless the firewall is designed to properly handle VVoIP traffic. Based on this degradation,  VVoIP must not traverse a standard data firewall except under certain circumstances. 
&gt; VVoIP aware/capable firewalls are being developed and few are deployed. 
&gt; DoD must purchase and use VVoIP/UC devices and firewalls that meet UC requirements as defined in the UCR. 
&gt; Confidentiality and integrity: Legacy (early) VoIP systems could not encrypt VoIP signaling or media to protect it for confidentiality and from various attacks while traversing a publicly accessible WAN (e.g., NIPRNet or Internet). This is changing due to the DoD’s efforts to develop interoperable VVoIP encryption standards with vendor assistance. The use of a MG eliminates the need for encryption on an IP WAN by placing the voice traffic on a traditional TDM network where the communications are more secure in general even though they are not encrypted. Physical access to the wire or TDM switch is required to compromise TDM communication whereas compromise could be effected from anywhere on an IP network. 
&gt; Availability and C2 support between sites via interoperability: VoIP systems from different vendors are typically not directly interoperable via IP. This  is primarily due to the lack of fully defined standards leaving vendors to develop their own extensions to the available protocols in support of unique feature sets. This is changing due to the DoD’s efforts to develop interoperable usage of the standards with vendor assistance. The use of a MG converts each vendor’s implementation to a common interoperable system, the TDM DSN.

• Is the VVoIP system within the site enclave subtended to a larger enclave and tethered (connected) to it via a direct cable, or a dedicated TDM or optical circuit (e.g., a T1, DS2, OCx )?

This is a finding in the event the site is not connected to the DSN via a MG located at the local site enclave as described above AND one of the exceptions is not applicable. 

NOTE: This requirement dictates that each site’s VoIP enclave has a local (on site) MG for connecting the site locally to a DSN EO or MFS. The DSN EO or MFS may be located at a remote site, in which case the TDM trunks will carry the voice traffic between the sites. This arrangement means that VoIP traffic does not have to traverse the enclave boundary with the WAN which is one of the reasons for the requirement.

As such they are considered mission critical and we have become accustomed to their high reliability and availability which is generally on the order of 5 nines. 

Many VVoIP systems are based on general-purpose operating systems such as Windows, Unix, LINUX as well as database and web server applications such as MS-SQL, Oracle, IIS, Tomcat, and others. Additionally, vendors of these systems usually customize or only use portions of the general-purpose operating systems and applications. Vendors also use and potentially customize open source software (OSS).

Vulnerabilities are discovered every day in these general-purpose operating systems and applications by the community their original vendors.  The vendors of these general-purpose systems and applications (such as Microsoft and others) routinely provide patches for their products to address bugs and vulnerabilities while other vendors and the OSS community provide upgraded versions of the software. These vulnerabilities and their mitigations usually appear in the DOD’s Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process as Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs). The process mandates that these IAVAs be addressed in a specific time frame based on the severity of the issue. Many times the mandated “fix” is to apply the original vendors patch or to upgrade to the “fixed” version of the software that has the vulnerability.

Due to the mission critical nature of our voice telecommunications systems, owners and operators must be cautioned against applying patches to their systems that are provided by the original vendor of the general-purpose operating systems and applications used in their systems as these may severely and adversely affect the operability of a portion of the system or may cause the system to crash. Significant down time could result which would amount to a self imposed denial of service.

To prevent operability issues and downtime to the greatest extent possible, the VVoIP system vendor must first determine if the OEM vulnerability and mitigating patch is applicable to their system or a portion thereof, and then test the mitigation/patch to validate that it will not degrade the system or its security. The IPT / VoIP vendor may have to modify the OEM patch or produce their own patch before releasing it to their customers. Obtaining a vendor tested and vendor approved patch from the system vendor provides the greatest assurance that responding to an IAVA will not involve a negative impact on the system.

To aid in this process, VVoIP system vendor must be advised of IAVAs that may apply to their systems. This is best accomplished by asking the vendor if the CVE or OEM patch number noted in the IAVA applies to your system and version of code. If so, they probably already have a tested and approved patch available for their customers. If not they will be alerted to the fact they need to provide one or test and approve the application of the OEM mitigation.

A PC could be dedicated to a task, protected, and controlled such that it is highly available for mission critical applications and communications. However, a user’s general purpose PC or other computing device may not be highly available for mission critical communications, particularly if it is not dedicated to that task. This because it supports many applications and functions while being connected to a network through which any number of threats can come. Mission critical applications and communications are also negatively affected if the PC is powered off, busy with another process, the communications application is not loaded or running properly, or if the PC is compromised and/or is having operational problems. While a fixed desktop or tower PC may be kept in a powered on and network connected state most of the time, a portable PC (laptop) is much more likely to be powered off and disconnected from the network. There is more chance that the PC and communications application won’t work, or be available, when needed compared to a dedicated device such as purpose built hard phones or dedicated PCs. Power for operating the PCs is another consideration in our discussion of their support for assured services and mission critical systems, users, and locations. If there is no power in the user’s workspace, the PC will not function unless a backup power supply is provided. Thus may be provided using a battery based Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) or a backup generator. Either solution is very costly when providing backup power to the workspace for the PC, particularly for large numbers of users. Provisions for light and other environmental factors may also be necessary adding to cost. On the other hand, power is much more easily provided to a hardware based phone from the wiring closet using the LAN cabling. A UPS or generator will still be needed but in a centralized location reducing cost. Another factor is the robustness and reliability of the network to which the PC is connected. As noted above, DoD networks can and must be designed and controlled to provide the reliability and robustness needed to support assured service. This can work well for a dedicated communications endpoint but not necessarily for a PC communications application. This is because the PC will be connected to the portion of the LAN that carries normal data traffic by default. That is the portion of the LAN that can be compromised and degraded by various DoS attacks and other issues making it difficult for this portion of the LAN to provide assured service. The VoIP STIG defines some of the LAN requirements for the support of assured service, most notably the separation of the voice assets and traffic on the LAN from the data assets and traffic while maintaining a converged LAN architecture. Various solutions may also be available that can allow a PC to mitigate or manage these issues. These will be discussed later in the LAN use case section of this STIG. 

A remotely connected PC cannot be relied upon to support assured service if it is connected to a non-DoD network such as an Internet connected LAN or the internet itself. This is due to lack of DoD control over the network to which it is attached. While most non-DoD LANs and the Internet are relatively reliable and may be robust regarding bandwidth, there is no control over the conditions in, or the availability of, these networks, whether it is the LAN or WAN. Based on the factors noted in the previous paragraphs, PCs cannot provide the reliability and availability required for assured service when compared to the reliability and availability specifications for a LAN supporting assured service. These factors make it difficult to consider a user’s general purpose fixed, or portable, PC as being a stable platform for mission critical communications in an assured service sense, even though that is desired. All of these factors also affect non-assured service systems that provide life safety and emergency communications. In the future, PC and PC based communications application vendors may solve these problems and provide us with fully assured service capable PC based communications on a standard general purpose, general use platform at a reasonable cost. These issues do not, however, preclude a PC based communications application from attempting to place and receive priority communications sessions. A C2 user may use this type of end instrument for the origination of, or reception of routine and non-routine calls at their discretion, as long as a purpose built instrument or other backup communications system/device is also available for use as a backup communications method when necessary. This however, may not be feasible in all situations such as when using a portable PC outside of the normal workspace.

Note: Voice communications is the most critical communications service for C2 users. While VTC and collaboration is an important C2 tool, a telephone call is the minimal method needed to give and receive orders. Since a PC based application may not be available at all times, backup voice communications methods are needed. This could be accomplished in several ways. Minimally, in the normal workspace, there needs to be a hardware based telephone, either IP or otherwise, connected to a different portion of the network than the PC. While a hardware based IP phone could be associated with the PC, if the portion of the network serving the PC was the cause of the PC being inoperable for C2 communications, the phone might also not be available or operational.

Applicability of this requirement can vary based on the specific use case and situation. For example, this is “not applicable” in the event a C2 user is in a situation where there is no need to place or receive priority calls.

This same sensitivity is included in VTUs that are used in office spaces. This has one disadvantage. The microphones can pick up sidebar conversations that have no relationship to the conference or call in progress. Likewise, in an open area, received conference audio can be broadcast to others in the area that are not part of the conference, and possibly should not be exposed to the conference information for need-to-know reasons. Speakerphones exhibit a similar vulnerability. This is the same confidentiality vulnerability posed to audible sound information in the environment as discussed above with the added twist that the conference audio is vulnerable to others in the environment. While this is more of an issue in environments where classified conversations normally occur, it is also an issue in any environment. This is of particularly concern in open work areas or open offices where multiple people work in near proximity. Users or operators of VTC systems of any type must take care regarding who can hear what is being said during a conference call and what unrelated conversations can be picked up by the sensitive microphone(s). Where a VTU is used by a single person in an open area, a partial mitigation for this could be the use of a headset with earphones and a microphone. While this would limit the ability of others to hear audio from the conference and could also limit the audio pickup of unrelated conversations, it may not be fully effective. In some instances, such as when a VTU is located in a SCIF, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) handset/headset may be required Microphones embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint, PC, or PC monitor can be sensitive enough to pickup sound that is not related to a given communications session. They could pickup nearby conversations and other sounds. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is not related to the communications in progress. Speakers embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint or PC can be made loud enough to be heard across a room or in the next workspace (e.g., cube). This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is being communicated during a session. Users must be aware of other conversations in the area and their sensitivity when using any communications endpoint, not only a PC based voice, video, or collaboration communications application. This awareness must then translate into protecting or eliminating these other conversations. A short range, reduced gain, or noise canceling microphone may be required. A push to talk microphone may also be required for classified areas. The microphone should be muted when the user is not speaking as both a mitigation for this issue, and for proper etiquette when participating in a conference. The muting function should be performed using a positively controlled disconnect, shorting switch, or mechanism instead of a software controlled mute function on the PC. Users must be aware of other people in the area that could hear what is being communicated. This is particularly an issue if the communicated information is sensitive or classified since the parties overhearing the information may not have proper clearance or a need-to-know. To mitigate this issue, a headset or speakers should be used and at a volume that only the user can hear. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;The inadvertent transmission of sensitive or classified information within the pickup range of a microphone or broadcast range of a speaker used for audio communications resulting in the improper disclosure of sensitive or classified information.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECND-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-16180r1_fix">Ensure a policy and procedure is in place and enforced that addresses the placement and operation of hardware based voice and video communications devices and PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications with regard to their audio pickup and broadcast capabilities in relation to the sensitivity of the information communicated.

In both cases, the displayed information typically resides on a PC. While in presentation/sharing mode, care must be exercised so that the PC user does not inadvertently display and transmit information on their workstation which is not part of the communications session and not intended to be viewed by the other communicating parties. Users must be aware that anything they display on their PC monitor while presenting to a communications session may be displayed on the other communicating endpoints. This is particularly true when the PC video output is connected to a VTC CODEC since the information will be displayed on all of the conference monitors. This presentation/sharing feature could result in the disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals that do not have a validated need-to-know or have the proper clearance to view the information. Thus the presentation/sharing feature presents a vulnerability to other information displayed on the PC if the feature is misused. This is a problem when sharing (displaying) a PC desktop via any collaboration tool using any connection method. There is little that can be done to mitigate this vulnerability other than to develop policy and procedures to present to collaborative communications sessions. All users which perform this function must have awareness of the issues and be trained in the proper operational procedures. Such procedures may require that there be no non-session related documents or windows open or minimized on the PC while presenting or sharing. An additional requirement may be that the user may not permit others in a session to remotely control their PC. A SOP is needed that addresses mitigations for the vulnerabilities posed by PC data and presentation sharing. Such an SOP could include the following discussion. If a user needs to view non meeting related information while presenting to a conference, the PC external display port must be turned off or better yet, the cable disconnected. Dual monitor operation of the PC could mitigate this problem somewhat. The second monitor output would be connected to the CODEC which would serve as the second monitor.

If this was to occur, there could be inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals without the proper clearance or need-to-know. This vulnerability could occur if the endpoint was set to automatically answer a voice, VTC, or collaboration call with audio and video capabilities enabled, or if the endpoint was compromised and remotely controlled. The stated requirements and mitigations involve muting the microphone(s) and disabling or covering the camera(s).

These or similar vulnerabilities could exist in PC based communications/collaboration applications due to an auto answer feature or compromised application or platform. As such, the simplest mitigation would be to only operate the software that accesses the microphone and camera when they are needed for communication. This does not work well for a unified communications application that is used to enhance our communications/collaboration capabilities since the application would be running most, if not all of the time when the PC is operating. In this case, the microphone could be muted and camera disabled in software as a mitigation. However, this also may not work well due to the possibility of the communications/collaboration application, microphone, or camera could be remotely activated if the platform or a communications application is compromised.  In this case positive physical controls may be required. We must also rely on our defense in depth strategy for protecting our PC applications, including our communications applications, from compromise. 

Physical disablement such as unplugging from the PC, using a physical mute switch, or covering a camera could work if using external devices. However, this mitigation would not work for embedded microphones and cameras as is the trend in laptops and monitors today. While it may not be easily feasible to physically disable an embedded microphone, the lens of an embedded camera can be covered.

Inspect a random sample of PCs that are not actively communicating to determine if the required mitigations are in place. 

NOTE: This requirement minimally involves muting the PC microphone and camera. If necessary, the camera lens must be covered, or the camera aimed at a blank wall to “mute” it. Ideally, the microphone and camera would be external devices and not embedded in the PC or an external monitor that could be disconnected from the PC when not needed. The external microphone and camera could remain connected to the PC if there was a positive physical disconnect or mute (shorting) switch for the microphone, and if the camera is disconnected by the switch or the camera lens is covered.

This is a finding if any of the inspected items are deficient such that audio and video pickup/capture capabilities of microphones and cameras associated with a PC are not disabled or inhibited when not required for communications such that inadvertent disclosure of aural or visual information is prevented.

These have been discussed previously and are not included in this section. Our discussion here relates to, soft-phone specific accessories, which consist of USB phones, USB ATAs, and PPGs. A USB phone is a physical USB connected telephone instrument that associates itself with the soft-phone application running on the PC. It minimally provides a handset which includes both the mouthpiece and receiver and may provide a dial pad, a speakerphone function, or other functions. In general, these devices do not pose a security threat other than those discussed previously under audio pickup/broadcast section above. They should be operated accordingly. A USB ATA is a USB connected device that associates itself with the soft-phone application and provides the ability to utilize a standard analog telephone or speakerphone. Some USB ATAs also provide a port to which an analog phone line can be connected. This allows a single analog phone to be used with the soft-phone while also answering and placing calls via the analog phone line. This line could be connected to a local PBX or to the PSTN. Some USB phones contain a port to which an analog phone line can be connected so the USB phone can be used with it to place and receive calls. There is little risk in the operation of this kind of USB ATA or USB phone providing it operates only as described and there is no direct bridging of networks as described next. A PPG (USB connected or internal card) is a type of ATA that is a gateway intended to bridge the soft-phone application and supporting VoIP network to an analog phone line from a local PBX or the PSTN. PPGs pose legal and fraud threats to a DoD network due to this bridging of networks. PPGs  can be used for toll fraud, toll avoidance, or placing or receiving unauthorized calls. Some USB Phones contain a PPG. While these devices might be used to meet a specific mission requirement, their use may be illegal in certain countries and instances when connected between a DoD IP voice and data network and a public dial-up voice network. The use of any soft-phone accessory that provides a network bridging function poses both a legal and an IA threat to the DoD voice communications network. PPGs must not be used except to fulfill a validated and approved mission requirement. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Soft-phone accessories that provide a bridging capability of the VoIP and the PSTN can be used for toll fraud, toll avoidance, or placing or receiving unauthorized calls.

The rules include the consequences of inconsistent behavior or non-compliance. Signed acknowledgement of the rules is a condition of access.”

This IA control requires the generation and use of a “user agreement” that contains site policy regarding acceptable use of various information system (IS) assets. Requiring the user to read and sign the user agreement before receiving their government furnished hardware and software, or before gaining access to an additional IS, add on application, or an additional privilege, provides the required acknowledgement. 

The Secure Remote Computing STIG requires that a user agreement be used and signed for a user to be permitted to remotely access a DoD network or system. The Wireless STIG adds policy items to this user agreement regarding the use of wireless capabilities in conjunction with remote access. This STIG will be no different in that we, the DoD IA community, must define acceptable use requirements for the use of PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications and accessories. While the first two STIGs mentioned require a user agreement prior to remote access privileges being granted, the user agreement should be signed when the user receives their government furnished hardware that covers all acceptable use policies. These policies are to include such things as acceptable web browsing, remote access, all wireless usage, as well as the usage of communications applications, soft-phone accessories, stick phones, personally configured VoIP, and IM clients. Minimally, the user agreement must be updated as privileges and certain applications are installed. User agreements must also be accompanied with user training and guides that reiterate the agreed to policies and provide additional information such as how to implement certain features and IA measures as required.

While this degrades the protections afforded a hardware based system, the trend is to use more and more PC based communications applications due to their advanced features, collaborative benefits, and perceived reduced cost. This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware based telephones on user’s desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service since the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. This also means that there will be no telephone available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, or the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. NOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware based instrument in the user’s workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user work space as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. The following is a list of some of these: • The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time. Users may not even have a means to report the failure without using an alternate communications system. A fast spreading worm or power outage could create such a situation. While some may argue that “users can call on their cell phones”, service may not be available or their use may not be permitted in the facility. This translates into the following: - The loss of functionality and efficiency as in lost time due to the inability to communicate when the PC or soft-phone application is not running or functioning properly. • The protections afforded hardware based endpoints by the use of the voice protection zone such as VoIP VLAN(s), and others are missing for soft-phones in a widespread use/implementation scenario and, depending on the implementation on the PC, may degrade the protections afforded hardware based endpoints. Such is the case for all software based communications endpoints since they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs. Assured service for voice traffic will be degraded from that obtained with hardware based instruments connected in the voice protection zone. This translates into the following additional IA measures required to protect the VoIP infrastructure (e.g., a firewall between the VoIP and data VLANs). • The hardware based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging onto the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has C2 responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. • Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a “soft-phone world” is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace which is an additional cost. This additional distance however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application not functioning properly, they may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending upon the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or law suites for this eventuality. • The previous 2 items translate into the following: - The addition of common use hardware based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency usage) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may feel that this is not an IA issue, in reality it is since the discussion is truly about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. Additionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware based instruments. NOTE: Methods for permitting the necessary PC traffic to, from, and between the voice and data zones while protecting the voice zone will be discussed later in this document.

This means that there is a validated mission need and the number of PC soft-phones permitted to operate inside the LAN will be less than the number of hardware based phones in the LAN. This number should be limited to those soft-phones required to meet specific mission requirements. UC applications that are ubiquitous in the LAN are addressed later, however, typically these work in association with a hardware based phone system, not in place of it. There are three possible scenarios for the use of limited numbers of soft-phones in the strategic LAN. We will discuss the first two in this section and the third in the next section. The first of these scenarios is providing support for soft-phones associated with a VoIP system in another enclave. This is a remote access scenario and must operate as they would in a normal telework/remote access use case. We will discuss this use case later, however, if this scenario is approved, special accommodations must be made in the local LAN to support users from a remote LAN and permit them to connect to their home enclave. This could include segregating them on a separate dedicated LAN with its own boundary protection or by implementing a dedicated VLAN protection zone while opening the enclave boundary to permit the remote connection. 

NOTE: Approval for this scenario would also require approval for specific foreign (non-local) PC attachment to the local LAN. These topics are beyond the scope of this document. The second of these scenarios is providing support for soft-phones associated with a local VoIP system. It is preferred that PC soft-phones associated with the local VoIP system not be used in the LAN, at all, due to the difficulties they present to the protection of the local hardware based VoIP infrastructure. Under normal circumstances, due to the separation of the VoIP and data VLANs a PC soft-phone application (associated with the local VoIP system) should not be able to register with the VoIP controller and function when the PC is connected to the LAN. This is because the PC connects to a LAN access port assigned to the data VLAN(s) and traffic between the voice and data VLANs is blocked. Similarly, if the PC was to be connected to a LAN access port assigned to the VoIP VLAN(s), the soft-phone might work but the PC would not have its normal data connectivity or services. If PC soft-phones are to be used in the strategic LAN, except as noted in the section on discrete instrument replacement, their numbers should be limited to those that are essential to the mission and additional protections, as discussed later in this section, must be added to the LAN to maintain the protection of the VoIP infrastructure. Implementations of limited numbers of PC soft-phones along with the protections afforded them and the local VoIP infrastructure must be approved by the responsible DAA.

Approval will be provided in writing and will be maintained by the IAO for inspection by IA reviewers or auditors.

If limited numbers of PC soft-phones associated with the local VoIP system are to be implemented in the strategic LAN, a separate protection zone or VLAN structure must be implemented for them. The purpose of this VLAN is to provide a means whereby the PC can access the services it requires in both the data and VoIP VLANs while protecting the VoIP infrastructure and enhancing soft-phone reliability, performance, and security. Implementation of such a VLAN must not provide an access path as in a bridge, between the VoIP and data VLANs. Traffic must be filtered such that the soft-phone’s VoIP traffic is routed to the VoIP VLAN while all other traffic is routed to the data VLAN. This should happen at only one location such as a core router or firewall, however, the PC might be capable of this itself. 

NOTE: Limited numbers in this scenario means as few as possible, but may mean 25 or 30 percent of the overall PCs on the LAN. Beyond this percentage, the protections afforded by this implementation become limited or negated because of the large number of PCs in the soft-phone VLAN.

NOTE: Methods for permitting the necessary PC traffic to, from, and between the voice and data zones while protecting the voice zone will be discussed next in this document.

Determine if limited numbers of PC soft-phones are permitted to operate or are implemented in the strategic LAN. If so, review the written DAA approval for the implementation/permission.

This is a finding in the event limited numbers of PC soft-phones are to be implemented in the strategic LAN and there is no written DAA approval for the implementation and the measures implemented to protect these soft-phones and the local VoIP and/or data infrastructure.

Traditional computer telephony integration CTI encompasses the control of a telephone or telecommunications switch by a computer application. Interfaces have been developed to provide connection between the computer, typically a workstation, and the telephone or other terminal attached to the telephone switch, and possibly a special analog or TDM line going directly to the telephone switch. Applications are also developed to make use of these interfaces to integrate a data application with the telephone system. Sometimes the integration is as simple as being able to dial a number from the computer application or it could provide full control of the switch as in the case of an operator’s console. In these traditional scenarios, the voice stayed in a traditional telephone set and the data stayed on the computer with the exception of the control information. If the voice does enter the computer, it is sent directly to the sound card or converted to a sound file for storage and possible file transfer. The voice communication is not transmitted in real time via IP protocols. In contrast, modern day CTI is changing in that today the voice communications and control is being transmitted using IP protocols and the hardware interfaces and telephones are being replaced by computer applications. 

NOTE: the CTI systems discussed here are not unified communications applications although some of the features are similar. CTI systems generally have a special function and are not a general user application. These are typically Call Center or Help Desk applications. This type of CTI typically involves integration with a database application. In this scenario, where soft-phones are an integral part of the CTI system/application, implementation of separate voice and data zones could be detrimental to the proper functioning of the application. While separation requirements should be enforced if possible, they could be relaxed providing the general CTI requirement of treating the CTI system as an enclave is followed. A system such as this should have its own VoIP controller. If the system needs to communicate with systems outside the CTI system enclave, proper boundary protection must be provided. For example, since IP soft-phones are prevalent in today’s call center / helpdesk systems, such a system would require the ability to place and receive phone calls from outside the CTI enclave. Calls might leave and enter the enclave via VoIP or a TDM media gateway. The workstations and call center agents may also need to email and access the web. 

NOTE: we have established that a network supporting a CTI application must be segregated from the enclave general business LAN and that this can be accomplished by maintaining a closed network or a segregated and access controlled sub-enclave having appropriate boundary protection. This is in support of DoDI 8500.2 IA control DCSP-1 regarding “Security Design and Configuration / Security Support Structure Partitioning” which states “The security support structure maintains separate execution domains as in address spaces, for each executing process by means of partitions, domains, etc., including control of access to, and integrity of, hardware, software, and firmware that perform security functions.”

In the event a Call Center / CTI system/application (e.g., call center, helpdesk, operators console, E911 system, etc.) utilizing or incorporating PC based soft-phones are approved for use in the strategic LAN, ensure the following:
- The supporting network is configured as a closed environment (enclave) or a segregated and access controlled sub-enclave having appropriate boundary protection between it and the local general business LAN or external WAN.
- In the event the CTI application accesses resources outside this enclave and there is the potential of the application being compromised from external sources, the supporting network is configured to provide separate voice and data zones and maintains separation of voice and data traffic per the VoIP STIG if technically feasible (i.e., such separation does not break the CTI application or there is another compelling reason).
- The supporting network enclave and boundary protection is configured in substantial compliance with the Enclave, Network Infrastructure, and VoIP STIGs.
- The CTI application/enclave (e.g., a call center application) is supported by a dedicated VoIP controller.

Inspect network drawings and perform a scan from outside the CTI system enclave to determine what traffic is permitted to flow between the CTI system and external network or VLANs. 

This is a finding in the event unnecessary traffic can pass.

These measures are designed to protect the VVoIP service and infrastructure to the greatest extent possible in the event there is a compromise of an OS or application on a workstation or server attached to the data side of the LAN. If this occurs, the compromised platform could be used by an adversary to compromise the VVoIP communications or its supporting infrastructure. Such compromise can happen rather easily, particularly when a server is a web or application server or a workstation is used for web surfing or email. A secondary reason for the implementation of the LAN architecture and security measures defined is to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of the supported VVoIP communications. Based on these two reasons, the defined VVoIP architecture serves to segregate and hide the VVoIP communications and infrastructure (to the greatest extent possible on a converged LAN) from the data workstation users and associated platforms. While VVoIP systems deployed on a strategic B/C/P/S provide a combination of general business or administrative communications along with C2 communications, tactical deployments primarily support C2 communications. There is nowhere other than a tactical deployment that the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of a VVoIP communications service is as critical. Therefore the network supporting a tactical VVoIP communications system must follow the same guidelines as a network supporting a strategic VVoIP system or application. 

NOTE: Initial deployments may include as little as a half dozen workstations or as many as fifty. Once the initial deployment is in place, the network may grow and become relatively permanent as would be the case for a rear command or logistics center. 
NOTE: A shipboard LAN is minimally considered as a fixed tactical LAN but can also be considered as a Strategic LAN. This is because the installation is permanent within the confines of the mobile floating base. In other words, the base (AKA ship) moves without disrupting the LAN.

Ensure permanent, semi-permanent, or fixed (not highly mobile) tactical networks supporting IP based voice, video, unified, and/or collaboration communications are configured per the requirements for a strategic LAN supporting voice/video/UC services.

Determine if the tactical LAN is supporting a fixed or generally non-moving base making it a fixed tactical LAN. If the fixed tactical network supports IP based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications, determine if it is configured per the requirements for a strategic LAN. Inspect network diagrams and interview the IAO to determine compliance. 

This is a finding in the event the deployed tactical network is relatively permanent compared to a small highly mobile unit and the LAN is not configured as a strategic LAN for the support of supports IP based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications as defined in this and other STIGs.

NOTE: The factors determining whether a deployed tactical VVoIP system is subject to this requirement are varied. In general all VVoIP systems should be configured the same and such that the service and supporting infrastructure is protected. It is recognized that a small system operated out of a transit case in a tent, conex box, or a truck is highly mobile as opposed to a fixed installation in a building. While initially such a system can support a few users and remain highly mobile, as the number of users increases, the deployment becomes semi-permanent, or fixed (not highly mobile). Initial deployments may include as little as a half dozen workstations or as many as fifty. Once the initial deployment is in place, the network may grow and become relatively permanent as would be the case for a rear command or logistics center. Small deployable packages that are designed to be initially deployed with a small footprint supporting or using PC soft-phones, which are then to be the basis of a larger network, must be configured, or be configurable, to support the separate VoIP and data zones as well as hardware based instruments and admission control for C2 communications as the deployed network and supported systems grow. The network will also include soft-phone protection zones as required in a strategic network if soft-phones are permitted to be used beyond the initial deployment. 
NOTE: A shipboard LAN is minimally considered as a fixed tactical LAN but can also be considered as a Strategic LAN. This is because the installation is permanent within the confines of the mobile floating base.

An argument could be made that a tactical LAN and attached workstations might be less prone to compromise than a strategic LAN and its attached workstations therefore we do not need all these security measures for VoIP. This argument might be supported by the smaller size of a tactical LAN, particularly an initially deployed system, mission duration, and the ability to limit its usage to tactical applications. Unfortunately if the tactical LAN is connected to NIPRNet or the strategic LAN at the home base, it can still be compromised particularly if general web browsing is permitted and performed and email is used. Additionally, there is nowhere that C2 communications is more important than in the tactical LAN. Any decision to eliminate any of the protective measures for the C2 voice service that could negatively impact its reliability must be based in a risk assessment that weighs the benefits against the risks. Deployable packages that are designed to be initially deployed with a small footprint supporting or using PC soft-phones, which are then to be the basis of a larger network, must be configured, or be configurable, to support the separate VoIP and data zones as well as hardware based instruments and admission control for C2 communications as the deployed network and supported systems grow. The network will also include soft-phone protection zones as required in a strategic network if soft-phones are permitted to be used beyond the initial deployment. In general, larger relatively permanent tactical networks should be configured the same as a strategic network since similar vulnerabilities exist. 

As a result, if IA measures are to be relaxed for a highly mobile tactical network or deployable package, the reduction must be supported by an approved benefit vs. risk analysis. Approval must be given by the person or entity responsible for accepting the risk of operating the VVoIP system in a vulnerable manner.

NOTE: This requirement does not apply to shipboard LANs since they are permanently installed.

NOTE: It is recognized that deployable packages for highly mobile tactical networks may only support PC based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications applications. Such a network may not require separate zones for voice and data since all traffic will be in the data zone.

Determine if IA configuration measures are reduced for highly mobile tactical networks (e.g., initial deployment packages) supporting hardware or PC based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications. If so, inspect network diagrams and device configurations to determine the IA measures implemented.

App. DoD APL Certificatio</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-17097r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1120 (GENERAL)</version><title>A PC Communications Application is not tested for IA and Interoperability and are not listed on the DoD UC APL.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;DoDI 8100.3 provides policy for the DoD that requires the testing and certification of telecommunications systems for Interoperability and Information Assurance (IA) while establishing an Approved Products List (APL) for certified and accredited products. Under Applicability and Scope, it states “This Instruction applies to the hardware or software for sending and receiving voice, data, or video signals across a network that provides customer voice, data, or video equipment access to the DSN, DRSN or PSTN.” Additional statements in this section expand this to most devices or systems that are associated with providing telecommunications service. 

The purpose of this testing is twofold. One aspect is to determine if a vendor’s product or system meets DoD functional requirements and that it can interoperate with established or existing DoD systems. The other aspect is to determine if the system can be configured to meet DoD IA requirements and operate at an acceptable level of risk. A product must be approved under both categories before listing on the APL.  

DoD components are required to fulfill their communications needs by only purchasing APL listed products, providing one of the listed products meets their needs. This means the APL must be consulted prior to purchasing a system or product. If no listed product meets the organization’s needs, they may sponsor a product for testing that does meet their needs. 

NOTE: The APL as created by this instruction was originally called the DSN APL and covered dial-up telecommunications systems or products providing unclassified communications. It has been expanded to cover additional types of approved products and has been renamed to the Unified Capabilities APL by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) for Networks and Information Integration (NII). Additional categories have been implemented for DRSN (classified communications) related systems/products and for IPv6 capable products. The APL can be found at http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/apl/index.html. This APL is referred to as the DoD APL or UC APL. 

Tactical use cases or systems that do not provide access to the DSN, DRSN or PSTN which are private closed communications systems, may be accredited via the Information Support Plan (ISP) or Tailored Information Support Plan (TISP) process managed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff J6I, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) United States (US) Military Communications Electronics Board (USMCEB) Interoperability Test Panel (ITP). 

This policy applies directly to any PC communications application that provides voice communications services to and/or from the DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN. This will most often be a soft-phone or unified communications application (with any associated accessories) that is associated with or supported by a DoD telephone system. The application may, or may not, provide additional communications services such as video, collaboration, or other unified communications services. This policy is extensible to other types of PC communications applications whose primary purpose may be VTC, IM, or collaboration, if the application or service provides interoperability with the DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN typically through a gateway, or uses these systems for transport.

NOTE : APL listing of soft-phone applications, and/or associated accessories, will be in association with, or part of, the listed VoIP telecommunications switch/system that supports the application. Other applications (VTC or collaboration) will be listed with their core service or system.

NOTE: This is not a finding in the event a PC communications application implementation and/or supporting system is not associated with, interoperable with, or connected to DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN and is never expected to be.

NOTE: The DRSN is a custom and proprietary non-VoIP telephone system. It interoperates, to a degree, with a Defense Information System Network (DISN) VoIP telephone system/service on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). This VoIP service is called VoSIP (see acronym discussion in the next note).  The discussion/requirement here applies to PC communications application associated with VoSIP that ultimately can interoperate with DRSN endpoints.  

NOTE: NSA defines VoSIP as Voice over Secure IP or regular (un-encrypted or encrypted) VoIP over any secure or classified IP LAN (i.e., local C-LAN) or WAN (e.g., SIPRNet or JWICS). In general, VoSIP employs encryption at Layer 1/Layer 2 applied to links between un-encrypted classified enclaves. The use of the acronym VoSIP for the DISN service and for instantiations on DoD component’s classified LANs leads to confusion between the service and the intentional meaning of the acronym. NSA defines a similar acronym, SVoIP, meaning Secure VoIP. This refers to end-to-end NSA type-1 encrypted VoIP media and possibly signaling streams that can traverse a network having a lower classification. This is similar in concept to the secure voice service provided by a STU or STE as well as SCIP based devices. SCIP works at Layer 7 (application layer) and can use Type 1 or Type 3 encryption. It is not IP specific since it was developed for traditional fixed and mobile transport methods. Type 3 encryption of VoIP signaling and media is not SCIP. Unfortunately, the SVoIP acronym/term has also been corrupted by some organizations using it to refer to their implementation of VoIP on their classified LANs and the SIPRNet WAN.

Inspect the APL testing report for the APL approved VoIP system supporting the PC communications application to determine if it was tested and approved along with the supporting communications system. 

NOTE: these applications are typically NOT listed separately on the APL. APL testing reports are available to DoD users of the product and reviewers via email from the Unified Capabilities Certification Office (UCCO) at ucco@disa.mil. It is highly recommended that requests for these reports are submitted and the report obtained before SRR trips commence. This is a finding if it is determined that the PC communications application was not tested and approved along with the supporting communications system.

The source of these applications can vary depending upon the type of application. To protect DoD interests, the source of the application depends on the criticality of the communications method. One source of possible compromise of a communications application is the use of freeware or shareware applications. This issue is covered in DoDI 8500.2 IA control DCPD-1 regarding “Security Design and Configuration / Public Domain Software Controls” which states “Binary or machine executable public domain software products and other software products with limited or no warranty such as those commonly known as freeware or shareware are not used in DoD information systems unless they are necessary for mission accomplishment and there are no alternative IT solutions available. Such products are assessed for information assurance impacts, and approved for use by the DAA. The assessment addresses the fact that such software products are difficult or impossible to review, repair, or extend, given that the Government does not have access to the original source code and there is no owner who could make such repairs on behalf of the Government.” Communications applications that primarily provide voice communications such as a soft-phone need to be designed to properly interoperate directly with the hardware based voice (VoIP) communications system. These applications should be a standard product of the voice system vendor or a partner whose product is approved by this vendor. The voice system is the most critical of all of the communications systems discussed in this document. 

Communications applications that primarily provide VTC ‘like’ communications can come from several sources. Some soft-phone applications provide VTC and collaboration features and should be sourced from the voice system vendor as noted previously. Applications that primarily provide VTC features and need to interoperate directly with a hardware based VTC system should be sourced from the VTC system’s vendor or a partner whose product is approved by this vendor. Communications applications that primarily provide collaboration services while also providing voice and video communications features must also be sourced from a major vendor in the business of providing collaboration systems or services. Unified communications applications that provide multiple services such as IM, presence, voice, VTC, web conferencing, and so forth, may also be a product of the PC’s operating system vendor as with Microsoft’s Office Communications applications. Application sourcing can also be dependant upon whether the application is to interoperate with a hardware based communications system located and operated within an enclave or whether it is a system operated by an interagency or inter-base program. This requirement is based on the fact that DoD components are required to use software and applications that are supported by a vendor that can maintain the security and integrity of the software or application. The vendor must be able to provide patches, upgrades or both to mitigate newly discovered vulnerabilities found in their product in a timely manner.

Determine the source of the PC voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications that are installed or are in use. 

Determine if freeware or shareware PC voice, video, UC, or collaboration communications applications are in use. Examples are applications from yahoo, MSN, Google, Skype and other third party applications downloadable from the internet via freeware and shareware distribution web sites.  

Inspect a random sample of PCs to determine what PC voice, video, UC, or collaboration communications applications are installed.

This is a finding if the PC voice, video, UC, or collaboration communications applications are either freeware / shareware, or are not sourced from the original manufacturer of the supporting voice, video, UC, and collaboration system. 

The only PC voice, video, UC, or collaboration communications applications that should be used are those licensed products from major communications system vendors such as Cisco, Nortel, Avaya, Polycom, Tandberg, and so on, for which a clear support path is defined.

This is to ensure PC voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications are obtained from an approved reputable source such that the integrity of the application along with its interoperability and security is assured and that support for the application can be provided to resolve operational and IA issues for DoD.

NOTE: this is NOT a finding in the event the applications in question are shareware/freeware or are sourced from a third party other than a major communications system vendor AND they are necessary for mission accomplishment; there are no alternative IT solutions available; and the product has been assessed for information assurance impacts, and approved for use by the DAA in writing. If this is the case, inspect the DAA approval documentation to validate.

This file contains the phone number assigned to the endpoint; the IP addresses (or URLs) of the LSC(s) with which the endpoint is associated; the software menus specific to the system; the password used to access the endpoint’s configuration;  the user’s personal preferences and speed dial numbers; as well as other information critical to the operation of the endpoint. NOTE: Hardware based VVoIP endpoints are like diskless computers on the LAN which need to download an operating system and configurations before they can operate. The code necessary to download this OS is stored in ROM or Flash Memory and is called firmware. To varying degrees some, most, or all of the endpoint’s OS can be stored on the device as firmware. The more of the OS that is stored the device, the quicker it initializes. In any case, no matter how much of the OS is stored as firmware, each endpoint requires a customized configuration settings file to be downloaded that individualizes the endpoint to meet the needs of the user to which it is assigned. These configuration settings can be updated occasionally or regularly by resetting and re-registering the endpoint, which causes an updated configuration file to be downloaded. Many PC based communications applications are fully configured locally on the platform, however, in some cases they rely on a configuration file downloaded from the system with which they are associated. The integrity of these files is critical to preventing compromise of the PC application, hardware endpoint, and the system itself. The best method for maintaining the integrity of these files is to require that they digitally signed. This can prevent man in the middle attacks where the configuration file could be modified in transit or the source of the file spoofed. Digital signatures and the file integrity must also be validated before the configuration file is used. NOTE: DoD PKI machine certificates are preferred for digital file signing, however, a vendor generated certificate would provide similar albeit not the same protection. LSCs and endpoints are to be assigned DoD machine certificates when the system operates as part of the DISN IPVS network. These certificates are also used for encryption purposes. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;VVoIP 1935/1936 &lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;DoD generated PKI certificates are the preferred certificates to be used in DoD operated systems.

Still other DoD policies require users of government furnished equipment (GFE) (i.e., DoD PCs/workstations) to limit their use to official business and not use them for personal business or other personal activities. Additionally, and more specific to this STIG, DoDI 8500.2 IA controls ECVI-1 and ECIM-1 to disallow general PC users from installing VoIP and IM clients that are intended to access public services for non-official, personal, use. An exception is made for the eventuality that such installations may be approved and performed by a DoD component for official business purposes. The IA controls state the following: • ECVI-1: “Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) traffic to and from workstation IP telephony clients that are independently configured by end users for personal use is prohibited within DoD information systems. Both inbound and outbound individually configured voice over IP traffic is blocked at the enclave boundary. 

NOTE: This does not include VoIP services that are configured by a DoD AIS application or enclave to perform an authorized and official function.” • ECIM-1: “Instant messaging traffic to and from instant messaging clients that are independently configured by end users and that interact with a public service provider is prohibited within DoD information systems. Both inbound and outbound public service instant messaging traffic is blocked at the enclave boundary. 

NOTE: This does not include IM services that are configured by a DoD AIS application or enclave to perform an authorized and official function.” 

NOTE: AIS in this case means Automated Information System and relates to an official program. The vulnerability is that installation of VoIP and IM clients that associate themselves with, and connect to a public VoIP or IM service places the DoD system on which the client is installed at risk of, and provides an avenue for, its compromise and unauthorized access. Once compromised, the system could be used as a launching point for further compromise of the network or other DoD systems. Additionally, the use of these services also places the confidentiality of DoD information conveyed by them at risk. Such information could be sensitive or the collection of non-sensitive information over time could reveal sensitive information. The mitigation of the vulnerabilities presented by these public services requires a two prong approach. The first is a technical approach, while the second is an administrative approach requiring user awareness, training, and agreements. A technical approach defined by the IA controls stipulates that traffic to and from public IM and VoIP services is to be blocked at the enclave boundary. It would be best if this were to occur at the NIPRNet Internet Access Points (IAPs), thus preventing such traffic from using the DISN, however this is not happening at this time since such blockage might also block other required services and the IAPs are not fully capable of such blockage at this time. This traffic must also be blocked at any Internet Service Provider (ISP) connection(s) to the enclave. 

NOTE: All ISP connections must be approved and operated under a waiver obtained from the Global Information Grid (GIG) waiver panel. It is the responsibility of the enclave to provide the required blocking since their firewalls and proxies are where the capability resides. To implement the mitigation, one might think that blocking specific IP addresses would be effective. This is not correct, however, since many of the public services have many IP addresses and servers, while they change their IP addresses regularly as a method of enhancing availability. Some of the public services have classically used non standard IP ports for their communications. Blocking these ports can be an effective measure in meeting the IA controls. Unfortunately, some of the public services are changing to use standard ports to get around the fact that many organizations block the nonstandard ports at their firewalls. The services are migrating to the standard ports 80 and 443 for web services which are generally never blocked. While the purpose of blocking these public services in the network is that this mitigation will prevent the application or service from functioning properly in the event one is installed. It is best to prevent the user from installing the client applications. This can be accomplished by limiting a user’s privileges on their PC such that they cannot install new software. This is typically done on many DoD PCs, however, some users require that ability. Also, unfortunately, just like the trend toward using standard ports, some services may function without a specific client by just using a web browser. This will most likely be the trend for the future. A seemingly more effective approach to blocking these public services or prevent their installation is to block them by their URL. This might be done at a proxy in the enclave boundary or on the PC itself by listing the URLs as un-trusted and setting the PC or proxy security or protection level such that un-trusted sites are blocked.

It controls the PPS that are permitted or approved to cross DoD network boundaries as well as mitigations for vulnerabilities inherent in the approved PPSs. Standard well known and registered IP ports and associated protocols and services are assessed for vulnerabilities and threats to the entire Global Information Grid (GIG) which includes the DISN backbone networks. The results are published in a Vulnerability Assessment (VA) report. Each port and protocol is given a rating of green, yellow, orange, or red associated with each of the 16 defined boundary types. Green means the protocol is relatively secure and is approved to cross the associated boundary without restrictions. Yellow means the protocol has issues that can be mitigated and it can be used if the required mitigations are used as noted in the VA. Red means that the protocol issues cannot be mitigated, is not secure, or approved, and in fact is banned when crossing that boundary. A new category is Orange which is the same as red except that the protocol is in use and cannot be removed from the network. It recognizes that the protocol exists on the network and is necessary but also mandates that new systems and applications must not be developed using this protocol whether it crosses a boundary or not. Some red and orange protocols have mitigations listed in their VA that must be used if the protocol is used during its remaining life. The information regarding the assessed ports and protocols and the defined boundaries is published in the PPS Assurance Categories Assignment List (CAL). See the Enclave and Network Infrastructure STIGS, the 8550.1, and the latest PPS CAL for a more complete discussion of this DoD program and policy. The PPSM information is available on the IASE and DKO/DoD IA Portal web sites. A portion of the DoDI 8550.1 PPS policy requires registration of those PPS that cross any of the boundaries defined by the policy that are “visible to DoD-managed components”. The following PPS registration requirement applies to all PPSs used by a Voice/Video/UC system to include the core infrastructure devices and its hardware based or PC application based endpoints whether or not a PPS crosses the IP based Enclave boundary to the DISN WAN or another enclave.

This is due to the lack of inter-vendor interoperability, end-to-end encryption, and the inability of VoIP to provide assured service in support of C2 communications reliability and priority requirements. The DSN PMO, DISA Engineering, and the Real Time Services (RTS) working group have been working to define network and system requirements to overcome the inherent obstacles in pursuit of a DISN wide interoperable assured service VVoIP or Voice Services network. In doing so, specific choices had to be made amongst the various technological and vendor solutions to provide the capability. These choices were made with the full cooperation of a consortium of vendor engineers. The following requirement reflects one of these choices made to meet DoD “confidentiality of data in transit” requirements under the DoDI 8500.2 IA controls ECCT-1 and ECNK-1 as well as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recommendations. 

NOTE: For the purpose of this document the DISN wide IP enabled DSN or RTS network will be referred to the DISN IP Voice Services network or DISN IPVS network. Real time IP communications (known as real time Services (RTS)) is comprised of signaling protocols which set up and manage the communications session and the media transfer protocols which carry the communications. Both signaling and media protocols and the resulting communications can be compromised when sent in the clear. One of the common means (per IETF recommendations) of initiating a RTS communications session across an IP network is to use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). To provide the assured service pre-emption and priority capabilities required for C2 telephone communications, DISA developed an extension to the SIP protocol (with the assistance of interested vendors) which is called Assured Service SIP or AS-SIP. The common means of providing confidentiality and integrity for SIP signaling as well as providing session authentication is to encrypt it using Transport Layer Security (TLS) as defined by the IETF recommendations. An additional factor to interoperability is the use of the same key management strategies at both ends of the session. The encryption algorithm, key strength, and key management processes are denied in the current version of the DoD Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) document available from the DISA voice Services PMO. 

NOTE: the devices in a VVoIP system that are required to provide this protection are all those involved in session initiation from end-to-end. These are the End Instruments (EIs), Media Gateways (MGs), Local Session Controller (LSC), Soft-Switch (SS), Multi-Function Soft Switch (MFSS), and Edge Border Controllers (EBCs) (which is the DISN IPVS/UCN VVoIP firewall).

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Voice phone services are critical to the effective operation of a business, an office, or in support or control of a DoD mission. We rely on these services being available when they are needed. Additionally, it is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation such as a security breach or life safety event. The capability or ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. While the DoD voice and data networks are designed to be extremely reliable, such that continuity of operations (COOP) is supported, there is the potential that a site’s EIs will loose the availability to communicate or signal with the LSC or MFSS. Reality is that if signaling messages cannot reach a LSC or MFSS, calls cannot be established. This is an issue even though the LSC and MFSS are specified to provide 5 9s availability; there are many other factors that affect the availability of these central devices. Natural disasters or physical damage to the network connections and/or pathways are just some. The following are considerations for meeting this requirement: 
• Large sites and Intranets: 
•• Redundancy of platforms – Two or more LSC controllers clustered o  Geographic diversity in locating the multiple LSCs within the site or Intranet 
• Small Sites (not dual homed): 
•• A single local subtended LSC may use a LSC to which it is subtended as the backup LSC for call control in the event the local LSC goes down. The best method for meeting this requirement on a large site is to implement redundancy for the LSC and the LSC portion of a MFSS. These redundant devices would then be located in redundant and geographically diverse facilities and connected to different parts of the LAN or CAN. This would mean that two core locations would be established within the site/enclave. LSCs and the LSC portion of a MFSS may be implemented on redundant platforms to meet the 5 9s availability requirements. Potentially these internally redundant devices might be able to be decomposed and located in the redundant facilities. Additional protections are needed for the communications between these decomposed elements. Additionally, each portion of the decomposed elements would need to be able to function on its own. In the event a site/enclave supports multiple tenants and one or more of these tenants have their own LSC, the main site could establish a COOP relationship with the tenant LSC and vise versa. An alternate method might be to establish a COOP relationship to a LSC or MFSS in another site or enclave. The issue with this arrangement is that the interconnection between sites is vulnerable and should be redundant with potentially COOP relationships with multiple LSCs at multiple sites. The best method for an Intranet served by a central LSC or MFSS is to place redundant LSCs in redundant and geographically diverse facilities which are then connected to different parts of the Intranet. Sites served by these LSCs should be dual homed using redundant circuits via geographically diverse paths.

We rely on these services being available when they are needed. Additionally, it is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability of maintaining the ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. While the DoD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable, such that continuity of operations (COOP) is supported, there is the potential that a site will be cut off from the DoD network. Additionally, some site’s DoD VoIP phone systems are implemented without a local LSC. The LSC is located at some remote location and may serve several sites, both large and small. This scenario is sometimes called “long Local” service. Such an implementation can be used in regionalized organizational intranets and in MOBs with their tethered GSUs. This implementation scenario provides for central management of the overall phone system, saves in initial implementation cost, and saves in operating costs. As such this scenario has many benefits. Unfortunately, the reality of this implementation is that in order to place a call between two endpoints within the local site or to place a call via the local commercial service connection, the initiating end instrument has to send its signal messages to the remote LSC over the DISN WAN connection, then the LSC has to signal the called instrument or MG over the same WAN connection. Several messages are sent (back and forth) over the WAN connection before the two local endpoints can send their media streams directly between themselves. While the need to signal over the WAN connection can cause longer call setup time which can be extended if there is congestion in the network, no call can be placed anywhere from the local site if it is cut off from its LSC. Based on this fact, and in support of maintaining viable local voice services in the event the site is cut off from its remote LSC, each physical site must maintain minimal local call control as a backup so that local intra-site and local commercial network calls can be placed. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DoD sites using the commercial network. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service, Lack of availability, inability to communicate within the site or with external entities; the inability to place emergency calls. &lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;COEF-1, DCBP-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20187r1_fix">Ensure the site has a backup VoIP call control capability such that normal or semi normal phone service is maintained in the event the site is cut off from the remote LSC or ensure the site has an alternate phone system or instruments through which local commercial calls can be made.

This file contains the phone number assigned to the endpoint; the IP addresses (or URLs) of the LSC(s) with which the endpoint is associated; the software menus specific to the system; the user’s personal preferences and speed dial numbers; as well as other information critical to the operation of the endpoint. 

NOTE: Hardware based VVoIP endpoints are like diskless computers on the LAN which need to download an operating system and configurations before they can operate. The code necessary to download this OS is stored in ROM or Flash Memory and is called firmware. To varying degrees some, most, or all of the endpoint’s OS can be stored on the device as firmware. The more of the OS that is stored the device, the quicker it initializes. In any case, no matter how much of the OS is stored as firmware, each endpoint requires a customized configuration settings file to be downloaded that individualizes the endpoint to meet the needs of the user to which it is assigned. These configuration settings can be updated occasionally or regularly by resetting and re-registering the endpoint, which causes an updated configuration file to be downloaded.

Many PC based communications applications are fully configured locally on the platform, however, in some cases they rely on a configuration file downloaded from the system with which they are associated.  

The confidentiality of these files is critical to preventing compromise of the PC application, hardware endpoint, and the system itself. Many vendors use configuration files of this sort that are a compact binary format that is only interpretable by the endpoint’s firmware or PD application. However, there is the potential that such files may be human readable as is XML code and most VVoIP signaling protocols. If the file is human readable, intelligence can be gathered by capturing the file while it is in transit. Additionally, the file is easier to understand and therefore makes it easier to modify it and then forward it to its destination. This facilitates man-in-the-middle attacks.

The best method for maintaining the confidentiality of human readable files is to require that they be directly encrypted or downloaded over an encrypted channel. This can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Encryption of this file is also required if the file contains the password used to access the endpoint’s configuration information and settings menus. While encryption will also protect binary files, the threat is less due to the inability to easily read the information in the file without a program designed to interpret the binary code.  As noted earlier, digital signatures and the file integrity must also be validated before the configuration file is used.

NOTE: To satisfy the encryption requirement here, the file can be encrypted directly (preferred) or downloaded over an encrypted channel. (This is applicable to PC applications only)

NOTE: Many of these configuration files are transferred using protocols such as BootP or TFTP which are designated “local management” per the DoD PPSM VAs for these protocols. These protocols are generally considered to be vulnerable due to their simplicity and lack of any security features. Per the DoD PPSM guidelines, a designation of “local management” means that PPSM recognizes the use of the protocol may be necessary within the LAN/enclave but it must remain within the LAN/enclave. This means that these protocols and therefore the configuration files transported by them must not traverse the WAN or enclave boundary unless protected by an encrypted VPN. As such, VVoIP endpoints that register with a LSC located in another LAN/enclave must do so via an encrypted site-to-site VPN between the enclaves or via an encrypted client-to-site VPN.

Policy excerpts are as follows: From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 (c) Availability requirements for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2 users is 0.999. From UCR 5.3.1.7.6 Availability LAN [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] The ASLAN has two configurations depending on whether it supports special C2 or C2 users. The ASLAN shall have a hardware availability designed to meet the needs of its subscribers: 1. Special C2. An ASLAN that supports special C2 users is classified a High Availability ASLAN and must meet 99.999 percent availability to include scheduled maintenance. 2. C2. An ASLAN that supports C2 users is classified as a Medium Availability ASLAN and must have 99.997 percent availability to include scheduled maintenance. [Required: Non-ASLAN] The non-ASLAN shall provide an availability of 99.9 percent to include scheduled maintenance. From UCR 5.3.1.7.7 Redundancy [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] The ASLAN shall have no single point of failure that can cause an outage of more than 96 IP telephony subscribers. In order to meet the availability requirements, all switching/routing platforms that offer service to more than 96 telephony subscribers shall provide redundancy in either of two ways: 1. The product itself (Core, Distribution, or Access) provides redundancy internally. 2. A secondary product is added to the ASLAN to provide redundancy to the primary product. See UCR 5.3.1.7.7.1 Single Product Redundancy and 5.3.1.7.7.2 Dual Product Redundancy for details. 

NOTE: In large LAN infrastructures, it is most likely that each network element in the core and distribution layers of the LAN will support in excess of 96 users whether they are C2 users or not. All users of VVUC services supported by the LAN deserve reliable communications, particularly in emergency situations. As such, these devices should possess the ability to fail-over to a redundant piece of hardware. At the network access layer (the layer where endpoints connect), this is more difficult. While redundant power supplies, backplanes, and processors can provide redundancy for a given NE, this is not possible for the portion of the NE to which the LAN drop cable attaches. Here there can be no automatic failover. The use of the 96 user figure at the access layer is in support of this requirement. Typically access layer modules or stand alone devices support 48 and fewer connections. So, while all access layer switches should have some form of internal redundancy, there is a point when this is not cost effective or possible. In this case, a failure must be mitigated by physically moving LAN drop connections to a hot-standby device or replacing the defective module.

The UCR in section 5.3.1.7.7.1 Single Product Redundancy states “In the event of a component failure in the network, all calls that are active shall not be disrupted (loss of existing connection requiring redialing) and the path through the network shall be restored within 5 seconds.” While the UCR is discussing hardware redundancy in this section it also discusses connectivity within the LAN as follows: 5.3.1.7.9 Survivability Network survivability refers to the capability of the network to maintain service continuity in the presence of faults within the network. This can be accomplished by recovering quickly from network failures quickly and maintaining the required QoS for existing services. For the ASLAN, survivability needs to be inherent in the design. The following guidelines are provided for the ASLAN: 1. Layer 3 Dynamic Rerouting. The ASLAN products that route (normally the Distribution and Core Layers) shall use routing protocols IAW the DISR to provide survivability. 2. Layer 2 Dynamic Rerouting. • Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) – RFCs 2787 and 3768. VRRP is able to provide redundancy to Layer 2 switches that lose connectivity to a Layer 3 router. The ASLAN shall employ VRRP to provide survivability to any product running Layer 2 (normally the Access Layer). These requirements translate into the need for redundant connections between all connected NEs within the LAN. As such this requires a single access layer or distribution layer NE to have two uplinks to the layer above. Additionally the physical paths these uplinks take should be physically diverse. Additionally, these paths should terminate in physically diverse locations (that is, different NEs in different locations) These measures represent best practices and should be utilized to support all VVUC users but are required for special-C2 and C2 users. The availability and reliability policy excerpts are repeated here in support of this requirement for convenience: From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 (c) Availability requirements for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2 users is 0.999. From UCR 5.3.1.7.6 Availability LAN [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] The ASLAN has two configurations depending on whether it supports special C2 or C2 users. The ASLAN shall have a hardware availability designed to meet the needs of its subscribers: 1. Special C2. An ASLAN that supports special C2 users is classified a High Availability ASLAN and must meet 99.999 percent availability to include scheduled maintenance. 2. C2. An ASLAN that supports C2 users is classified as a Medium Availability ASLAN and must have 99.997 percent availability to include scheduled maintenance. [Required: Non-ASLAN] The non-ASLAN shall provide an availability of 99.9 percent to include scheduled maintenance. From UCR 5.3.1.7.7 Redundancy [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] The ASLAN shall have no single point of failure that can cause an outage of more than 96 IP telephony subscribers. In order to meet the availability requirements, all switching/routing platforms that offer service to more than 96 telephony subscribers shall provide redundancy in either of two ways: 1. The product itself (Core, Distribution, or Access) provides redundancy internally. 2. A secondary product is added to the ASLAN to provide redundancy to the primary product.

In traditional telecommunications systems the need for backup power is the same but it can be met generally at a single location, which is the phone switch location. The power required by the endpoints is generally provided by the phone switch to maintain basic dial tone services even though some “digital and feature phones require a local power supply. This is not possible in an IP/LAN based VVoIP network because the LAN infrastructure is geographically spread out to be within 100m cabling distance from each LAN endpoint. As such, the power, both primary and backup, must follow the NE to its location. Centrally located core equipment must also have a central uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The endpoints also need continuous power to maintain service. IP telephony endpoints require power to operate. This can be provided locally with a power brick (a small plug-in power adaptor/supply) and an AC outlet or can be provided by the LAN using Power Over Ethernet (POE) technologies. The UPS providing backup power to the LAN access switch can also provide backup power to the endpoint via POE if properly sized. If this is not the case, an individual UPS is required for each instrument supporting special C2 and C2 users of the proper capacity. Policy sets the minimum requirements for the backup power supplied to the VVoIP systems and the supporting LAN and VVoIP endpoints with emphasis on supporting C2 communications when primary power is lost. While this is a very valid case, it is also best practice, if not critical, to provide some level of backup power to the core systems, LAN, and endpoints that only support C2R and non-C2/admin users to support some level of reliable/survivable service, especially for emergency life-safety and security calls. NOTE: The requirement here for UPS support for C2R or Non-C2/admin users communications is negated in the event that such users have an alternate reliable means of communicating in such situations. Personal and potentially even government provided cell phones are not the answer since there are many locations in DoD facilities where they are prohibited and/or signal availability is unreliable. An alternative to this could be to put a policy and SOP into effect that requires such users to evacuate the facility to a location where the appropriate communications capability is available. The policy excerpts driving this requirement are as follows: From the UCR 5.3.1.7.5 Power Backup [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] To meet CJCS requirements for assured services, equipment serving special C2 and C2 users must be provided with backup power. The ASLAN must meet the power requirements outlined at a minimum as follows: Special C2: The ASLAN must provide an 8-hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to special C2 users. Any ASLAN product, Core, Distribution, or Access that supplies service to the special C2 user must have an 8-hour UPS. 2. C2: The ASLAN must provide 2 hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to C2 users. Any ASLAN product, core, distribution or access, that supplies service to the C2 user must have a 2 hour uninterruptible power system (UPS). 3. C2(R) or Non-C2: C2(R) or non-C2 users may lose telephony service in the event of a power failure. NOTE: Backup Power (Environmental). The backup power system shall have the capacity to operate environmental systems needed to sustain continuous equipment operation. Power to the environmental systems may not need to be continuous. From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 with eight hours uninterrupted power supply. (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 with two hours uninterrupted power supply. (c) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2/admin users is 0.999 with no uninterrupted power supply. NOTE: While current DoD policy dictates that the VVoIP system as a whole only provide C2 and C2R users with specific durations of continued service during a power failure (as a cost saving measure), it is highly recommended that the entire system be provided some level of UPS. Traditional phone service is generally always available in a power failure since the endpoint or subscriber instrument is powered from the telephone switch. While there are exceptions to this regarding feature phones and some digital phones that need local power, for the most part all analog phones and others powered by the switch always work when local power is out. As noted above, VVoIP service is subject to disruption if power to the LAN infrastructure is disrupted. This can happen at various points since the LAN is a distributed (non-centralized) network. When implementing a VVoIP system without considering UPS power needs for the VVoIP controllers and endpoints as well as entire LAN, and supporting those needs with UPSs, we are reducing the availability of the telecommunications service that we are accustomed to. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Reduced or no availability and denial-of-service.

This intra-enclave protection is required by DoD IA policy (DoDD 8500.1) which states: “defend the perimeters of enclaves; provide appropriate degrees of protection to all enclaves and computing environments.” More specifically DoDI 8500.2 IA controls EBBD-2 and EBBD-3 regarding Enclave Boundary Defense for sensitive and classified systems respectively state, in part, “Boundary defense mechanisms to include firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (IDS) are deployed at the enclave boundary to the wide area network, at layered or internal enclave boundaries, and at key points in the network, as required.” The key portion of these IA controls addressed here is the part that states “at layered or internal enclave boundaries, and at key points in the network, as required.” This is further qualified by the definition of an enclave which states in part: Enclave: A collection of computing environments connected by one or more internal networks under the control of a single authority and security policy, including personnel and physical security. Based on this definition, the local LAN enclave, remote MILDEP NOC, the DSN’s ADIMSS network, the RTS EMS, and the DISN DCN are different enclaves. Therefore IA control EDDB-x is applicable and minimally a firewall is required where these enclaves meet. This requirement is generally applicable to VVoIP core system devices and TDM based telecom switches that are managed via multiple networks and specifically applicable to those where those systems and devices are managed via a single physical Ethernet/IP interface. As an example, if the ADIMSS and local SAs both manage a TDM switch or VVoIP system/device via a common pathway e.g., the local management VLAN or OOB management network, a firewall is required between the local network and the ADIMSS network. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.

Additionally, ensure the enclave boundary protection configuration only permits specific protocols to flow between specific pairs of IP addresses across the boundary as required for proper operation of the management mission. Validate the effectiveness of the boundary protection on an annual basis.

NOTE: Per EDDB-x proper boundary protection is defined as a firewall and IDS.

NOTE: All intrusion alerts or alarms generated by the IDS or firewall should be reported in real time to the service level NOC and/or CNDSP NOC associated with each enclave with potential additional reporting to a DISN level NOC such as a TNOSC or GNOSC.

If there is a single boundary protection device, additionally determine if there is a MOA regarding the operation of the device such that the owner implements a configuration that not only protects the owner’s network but also protects the other’s network. Further validate that both parties have agreed to (signed) the MOA. If there is no such MOA, the respective owners may need to implement their own devices.

Implement ACLs that provide a deny-by-default posture such that only the specifically required protocol traffic between specific pairs of IP addresses is permitted across the boundary. 

More specifically, ACLs should be defined as follows:
Inbound ACL:
&gt; Permit the specifically authorized and required protocol sourced from the IP address of the specifically authorized device on the DISN management network to reach the specific IP address of the managed device or required local management server.
&gt; Additional statements for each protocol and IP address pair.
&gt;Deny all other traffic.
Outbound ACL:
&gt; Permit the specifically authorized and required protocol sourced from the specific IP address of the managed device or any required local management server to reach the specific IP address of the specifically authorized device on the DISN management network.
&gt; Additional statements for each protocol and IP address pair.
&gt;Deny all other traffic.

The net result of this ACL is to permit authorized devices to communicate while blocking unauthorized access from the local management network and any attached workstations to the DISN management network and to block access from the DISN management network to all devices on the local management network other than the required managed devices or management servers. 

NOTE: An ACL statement is required for each IP address on the local management network that must communicate across the boundary to provide proper control. Defining ACLs to permit a subnet, while easiest, will not provide the proper control. This is supported by the previously started requirement that managed devices are all required to have static IP addresses.  This requirement is extend to management servers and potentially to management workstations.

Validate the effectiveness of the boundary protection ACLs on a regular basis and/or minimally on an annual basis by performing network vulnerability scans as follows:
&gt; Scan the entire DISN management network (e.g., RTS EMS, ADIMSS, ARDIMSS, or DCN), address space from an unused randomly selected IP address on the local management network. 
&gt; Scan the entire local management network address space from an unused randomly selected IP address on the DISN management network.
The expected result is no response from any host on either network.  

NOTE: While this scan is useful in determining if the boundary protection works by blocking access from a randomly selected IP address, a more effective test would be to perform the scan from a randomly selected management workstation. A different workstation should be selected each time the scan is performed.

Unauthorized access can lead to complete corruption of the system or device, causing the loss of availability (denial-of-service), integrity, and information or communications confidentiality. As such management interfaces and the management traffic they transmit or receive must be protected. The most effective method for providing this protection is to establish a separate dedicated network for the purpose of managing systems, devices, and network elements. Such a network is typically called an out-of-band (OOB) management network. Such networks can be expensive to establish depending on the geographical placement of the managed devices. This protection can also be afforded the management interfaces and traffic on the same network as the production traffic uses, but the process is more difficult and protection requirements more stringent. This method is called In-Band management. When using in-band management, the most effective method for providing management interface and traffic protection is to establish a separate dedicated management VLAN on the production network. Another method for protecting management traffic is the use of secure protocols and encryption. The Network Infrastructure STIG defines the requirements for both in-band and OOB management. In-band management is permitted for the typically geographically disbursed network elements using a dedicated management VLAN and logically separate management interfaces on each NE. In general the management of VVoIP core systems and devices must follow the NI STIG/checklist guidance. This means that these systems/devices can be managed via an OOB management network or an in –band VLAN. While this is the case, the this management access must be segregated from all other management VLANs on the network. The purpose of the separate VVoIP management VLAN or OOB network is to provide for separation of access in support of separation of duties between the data network or server SAs and the VVoIP system SAs. In some organizations these SAs are from different departments or just have different duties that don’t require that they have access to all devices on the network. The VVoIP management VLAN or OOB network may be accessed from the general LAN management VLAN/OOB network or other management VLANs or networks via a controlled ACL, gateway.

Only the required protocols are to reach a given VVoIP device thereby protecting it from non-essential protocols. This protection is afforded on the LAN by implementing ACLs based on VLAN/subnet, protocol and in some instances specific IP addresses. While a firewall placed between the core equipment and endpoint VLANs might provide better protection for the core equipment as a whole, a router is best suited to control the varying traffic patterns between the various devices. Normally a large B/C/P/S will have a large LAN and one or more LSCs supporting a large VVoIP phone system. In this case, it is within normal network design parameters to employ routing devices at the core of the LAN within the enclave. As such, the VVoIP system’s core equipment would be connected to these routing devices or have one or more routing devices of its own. 

NOTE: It is recognized that small LANs and enclaves may not support VVoIP phone system core equipment as would be the case if they used a “managed service” or a remote LSC. In such a LAN the number of VLANs might be limited to one for data and one for VoIP. Also, a small LAN may not have a router at its core, potentially due to cost, thereby not having the capability of supporting multiple VVoIP VLANs. In this case, this requirement does not apply and all VVoIP endpoints and local VVoIP infrastructure equipment would be in a single VLAN. However, the use of a Layer 3 LAN switch instead of a dedicated router may be a cost effective method to meet this requirement for small LANs.

These reasons are as follows: 
&gt; Most high capacity local commercial voice service (more than a few individual lines) is delivered from the carrier via TDM trunks. This requires the conversion to VoIP via a media gateway. 
&gt; The implementation or receipt of commercial VoIP service from an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP), would require the implementation of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) connection or a connection into the service provider’s network via a VPN or dedicated TDM or optical circuit. In effect, a connection into the service provider’s network would provide a path to the Internet. These types of local connections provide a “back door” into the local network that can place the entire DISN or GIG at risk from exploitation and can circumnavigate the protections put in place by the operators of the DISN (DISA). Such connections need to be specifically approved under CJCSI 6211.02C and DODI 4640.14.  Such connections must also meet the requirements in the Network Infrastructure STIG for an “Approved Gateway.” This generally means that a full boundary architecture has to be implemented. Specific requirements for the implementation of commercial VoIP service will be defined later. NOTE: The term “back door” as used here means an illicit or UN-approved connection and is not intended to have the same meaning as the term “backdoor connection”, as defined in RFC 2764, and used in the Network Infrastructure STIG. NOTE: A PRI or CAS trunk is required because the DSN is not permitted to exchange SS7 signaling with the PSTN. Doing so would place the DoD’s SS7 network at risk. 
NOTE: The implementation of local ITSP connections to utilize commercial VoIP services at all BCPS would mean the implementation of an OSD / Gig Waiver Panel “approved ISP gateway” at each BCPS. This would amount to over 1000 direct connections between the Internet and the NIPRNet via the BCPS LAN. While these connections might be limited to VoIP only traffic, these would have the potential to be mis-configured in such a way that the connection provides an open “back door” for general access, Internet traffic, and attacks. This presents a huge risk to the DISN which is unacceptable. It is therefore highly unlikely that DoD will take such an approach and approve such connections.

We rely on these services being available when they are needed. Additionally, it is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability of maintaining the ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. While the DoD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable, such that continuity of operations (COOP) is supported, there is the potential that a site will be cut off from the DoD network. Based on this fact, each physical site must maintain local commercial phone service in the event the site is cut off. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DoD sites using the commercial network. An additional, non IA benefit is that this supports the ability to make local calls without having to pay toll charges to call a local number via some distant regional access point. Local phone service can be delivered in a number of ways, all of which meet this requirement, while some of them must meet additional requirements to secure them. 

Delivery options are as follows: 
&gt; PRI or CAS TDM trunks  
&gt; Analog phone lines The type and amount of local phone service required can also depend upon the size of the site. 

The following are some examples: 
&gt; A large site or main operating base (MOB) could use PRI or CAS TDM trunks connected to the site’s PBX. The larger the site the more trunks are used. 
&gt; A small site or geographically separate unit (GSU) attached to a MOB. 
&gt;&gt; May have a PBX and be served similar to a large site.

While this is relatively easy for data transmission, this is not an easy task for voice and video communications, particularly when the state of the art for VoIP communications today has developed along different paths followed by each vendor. As such, VoIP communications has not been interoperable between different vendor’s systems or between these systems and the various VoIP services that are available today. The task is made more difficult by the fact that the transport medium, that is IP networks, are generally not designed to transport time sensitive communications. Information contained in packets is transported in a manner that ensures the information will get to its destination reliably, although not in a specific amount of time. This is not acceptable for packetized voice and video since lost or delayed packets affects intelligibility of the communications. An additional aspect of assured service voice communications is that of call or message priority. Some calls, that are high priority C2 calls, must be completed at the expense of lower priority or routine calls. DISA has worked to overcome these issues by working with the many vendors that provide telecommunications equipment to the DoD to develop a highly available, reliable, and interoperable IP based assured service voice and video communications network to meet the needs of its C2 customers. Additional DoD policy dictates that DISN services be used as the first choice for DoD components to fulfill their long haul communications needs. For dialup voice, video, and data services the Defense Switched Network (DSN) has fulfilled this role for sensitive but unclassified communications. Similarly the Defense RED Switched Network (DRSN) has fulfilled this role for multi-level classified voice communications. 

As DoD migrates to an all IP based DISN, the IP based voice services with the addition of video will fulfill this role into the future. A single vendor, classified, secret level, IP voice communications system has been implemented on SIPRNet which is currently called VoSIP. VoSIP stands for Voice over Secret (or secure) IP. This service and the supporting network are expected to provide assured service in the future. 

For the purpose of this document, assured voice/video communications services (classified or unclassified) on the DISN is designated as DISN IP Voice Services (IPVS). 

As such, if the VVoIP system within the enclave connects to the DISN WAN for VVoIP transport between enclaves AND the system is intended to provide assured service communications between enclaves to any level of C2 user (Special C2, C2, C2(R)), the system must be integrated with (or subscribed to) the worldwide DISN IPVS network operating on the appropriately classified DISN IP WAN service.

As such, the worldwide availability and effectiveness of this service is dependant upon the components of the overall system that are located in each interconnected enclave. These components must be interoperable and support the needed quality of service. Therefore, if the VVoIP system in an enclave is to utilize the DISN IPVS to communicate with other enclaves across the NIPRNet, the system must be designed with equipment that has specific capabilities. Additionally, the implementation of VVoIP across the enclave boundary must not degrade the security or protection of the enclave. Use of the DISN IPVS network requires the following equipment such that interoperability is assured across the DISN service: &gt; One or more DOD APL listed Customer Edge Routers (CERs) on which the DISN access circuits are terminated. The CER is robust/reliable and provides QOS features / capabilities as required by the UCR for the specific type of site. 

NOTE: The CER is the enclave’s perimeter or premise router as designated by the Network Infrastructure and Enclave STIGs. &gt; One or more DOD APL listed Local Session Controller’s (LSCs) or Multi-Function Soft Switch (MFSS) within the enclave for session control. These are the system control and signaling agents of the system. The LSC and MFSS are robust/reliable and provide admission control, and QOS features / capabilities as required by the UCR. The LSC (one or more per site) manages local endpoint registration and calls established to/from local endpoints and facilities. Also manages calls into and out of the enclave. The MFSS (typically one per site) performs LSC functions for its site and provides signaling management for a regional set of LSCs. &gt; Each LSC or MFSS and CER will be separated by a firewall or session border controller having specific functionality as defined in the UCR. This DoD specific device is called an Edge Boundary Controller (EBC). This may be a dedicated device or may be a functional part of the required data firewall. The use of these devices is critical to the success of the DISN IPVS’s mission. Additionally, The typical perimeter or premise router (as designated by the NI and Enclave STIGs) will most likely not be capable of supporting the needs of VVoIP entering the DISN WAN. This is because only newer routers are capable of dealing with service classes and expedited forwarding. This why the DISN IPVS PMO specifies the specific additional capabilities required of the perimeter or premise router to support the needs of the Assures Service network. The router designated by the DISN IPVS PMO that is needed to support the service is called the Customer Edge Router (CER). This terminology is consistent with the terminology used by the DISN CORE PMO and other WAN service providers. The CER provides the following functionality: &gt; Provides minimally four expedited forwarding cues (eight may be required in the future) &gt; Places traffic within expedited forwarding cues based on the DSCP markings carried by the traffic &gt; Routes AS-SIP-TLS packets and SRTP/SRTCP packets to the EBC function.

As such, the worldwide availability and effectiveness of this service is dependant upon the components of the overall system that are located in each interconnected enclave. These components must be interoperable and support the needed quality of service. Therefore, if the VVoIP system in an enclave is to utilize the DISN IPVS to communicate with other enclaves across the NIPRNet, the system must be designed with equipment that has specific capabilities. Additionally, the implementation of VVoIP across the enclave boundary must not degrade the security or protection of the enclave. 

Use of the DISN IPVS network requires the following equipment such that interoperability is assured across the DISN service:
&gt; One or more DOD APL listed Customer Edge Routers (CERs) on which the DISN access circuits are terminated. The CER is robust/reliable and provides QOS features / capabilities as required by the UCR for the specific type of site. NOTE: the CER is the enclave’s perimeter or premise router as designated by the Network Infrastructure and Enclave STIGs.
&gt; One or more DOD APL listed Local Session Controller’s (LSCs) or Multi-Function Soft Switch (MFSS) within the enclave for session control. These are the system control and signaling agents of the system. The LSC and MFSS are robust/reliable and provide admission control, and QOS features / capabilities as required by the UCR. The LSC (one or more per site) manages local endpoint registration and calls established to/from local endpoints and facilities. Also manages calls into and out of the enclave. The MFSS (typically one per site) performs LSC functions for its site and provides signaling management for a regional set of LSCs. An MFSS is a backbone device and is only required at DISN IPVS PMO designated locations.
&gt; Each LSC or MFSS and CER will be separated by a firewall or session border controller having specific functionality as defined in the UCR. This DoD specific device is called a Edge Boundary Controller (EBC). This may be a dedicated device or may be a functional part of the required data firewall. 

The use of these devices is critical to the success of the DISN IPVS’s mission

NOTE: As noted in the LAN section, on a large facility (site) the primary LSC should have a backup LSC that is geographically separate from it. This is also applicable to a facility/site that has a MFSS. While the MFSSs work in pairs in the backbone and are therefore redundant with regard to backbone services, their LSC functionality should also be redundant.

This method includes or supports providing precedence and priority capabilities for C2 users similar to the MLPP service provided by the traditional TDM based DSN. The enclave’s internal LAN is required to be designed to be non-blocking. That is it must provide ample bandwidth for all the traffic that it is expected to carry. This is controllable by DoD. On the other hand, the DISN Core is designed to have ample bandwidth and expandability to support what ever traffic the DoD enclaves throw at it. As such it is considered to be bandwidth rich. Due to issues surrounding the ability for an attached enclave to determine the bandwidth availability or congestion conditions within the core in real time, an assumption has to be made that the DISN Core is also non-blocking. The DISN Core bandwidth is also controllable by DoD. The portion of the overall DISN network that is bandwidth constrained is the TDM or optical OCx access circuits between the local enclave and the DISN Core. This is the portion of the network where we have the least control over bandwidth availability, primarily due to the cost of these circuits. The cost factor is an issue since many DISN access circuits must rely on commercial carriers for some portion of the overall circuit. This is typically the portion that delivers the DISN service to the B/C/P/S. Access circuit issues are less of an issue if the B/C/P/S also provides a home for one of the DISN Core SDNs. This is because a direct connection can be made between the CER and the SDN, however, the circuit capacity may still be an issue if the SDN is a small one that does not have an AR or PE. Due to the nature of digital transmission over these bandwidth constrained circuits, the quality and availability of the communications is degraded as these circuits become congested. “Data” packets can wait until processed without negatively affecting the delivery of a message. This is not the case for VVoIP due to its time sensitive nature (it is a real time service). If VVoIP packets have to wait for transmission, the quality of the call suffers. In IA terms, this relates to the availability of the service and quality communications. To overcome the bandwidth constraints inherent in WAN access circuits, an engineered bandwidth budget must be developed for each service (voice, video, and data) using the circuit. Voice and video budgets are developed in terms of call or session counts. For example, the UCR defines a voice call as follows: “One voice session budget unit shall be equivalent to 110 kilobits per second (kbps) of access circuit bandwidth independent of the EI codec used. This includes ITUT Recommendation G.711 encoding rate plus Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) packet overhead plus ASLAN Ethernet overhead. IPv6 overhead, not IPv4 overhead, is used to determine bandwidth equivalents here.” 

NOTE: This budget is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. 

NOTE: The VoIP budget covers the following types of services: Voice VoIP, FoIP, MoIP, or SCIP over IP calls The UCR also defines a video call as follows: “Since the bandwidth of a video session can vary [depending upon video resolution (ed)], video sessions will be budgeted in terms of video session units (VSUs). One VSU equals 500 kbps and bandwidth for video sessions will be allocated in multiples of VSUs. For example, the bandwidth allocated to video sessions may be 500 kbps, 1000 kbps, and 2500 kbps. Thus, a video session that requires 2500 kbps will be allocated five VSUs.” 

NOTE: This discussion, as it relates to video, is in regard to video sessions controlled by the LSC using AS-SIP for the signaling protocol. H.323 signaled video and/or VTC sessions must be considered separately and potentially have their own budget for access circuit bandwidth. 

NOTE: This budget (which also includes the audio component) is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. When developing the bandwidth budgets, the engineer must determine how many simultaneous voice and video calls/sessions are to be supported by the access circuit based upon the unit per call defined in the UCR. The bandwidth budget to be reserved for voice is then calculated along with a budget for video. Next the engineer must determine what percentage of the overall access circuit bandwidth these reserved budgets should consume. The access circuit is then sized (ordered) to accommodate the needs. It is not recommended that IP voice and video capabilities be added to an existing circuit since this would mean the call/session counts would have to be restricted or the data budget would have to be squeezed. 

NOTE: Data traffic is permitted to surge into the voice and video budgets if the bandwidth is available; however the voice and video budgets are reserved and will be reclaimed if needed. Voice and video is not permitted to surge into the data budget since ASAC needs a fixed call count to be effective. 

NOTE: Instructions for determining voice call budgets for a DISN WAN access circuit can be found in the UCR section 5.3.3.11 Provisioning

It does not matter how reliable, redundant, and robust the CER, EBC, and power supply is (required to be 5 – 9s reliable), the facility housing this equipment represents a single point of failure. While this may be deemed to not be an issue for a small number of C2 users, the more C2 supported by the system, the greater the issue because all communications would be cut off in the event the facility is lost or severely damaged. Even less severe eventualities may also severely limit the capability of the system to support reliable communications. The mitigation for this system wide vulnerability is to implement redundant facilities to which the geographically diverse pathways containing the dual homed access circuits can run and terminate on redundant, geographically separated sets of CERs, EBCs, and core LAN equipment. LSCs can also be separated in this manner.

Understandably, the mitigation for this issue is costly and facilities housing critical communications infrastructure are not lost very often. However, the cost of mitigating this vulnerability must be weighed against the loss of critical communications, particularly in time of crisis. If the site supports large numbers of high level C2 users or special C2 users, the cost of losing communications may outweigh the cost of providing redundant facilities. Another aspect of the loss of communications is that access to emergency services via the communications system would also be lost. The more users affected by such a loss the more the potential need to place calls to emergency services.  

As such, all sites, large and small can benefit from the implementation of redundant facilities and equipment. 

NOTE: The threat to strategic facilities is far greater from natural causes than from damage due to acts of war or terrorism, but all threats need to be considered. On the other hand, tactical facilities naturally have a higher vulnerability to acts of war, which are raised on a par with or exceed the vulnerability posed my natural events.

Additional information should be added if the phone is found to be non-functional such as maintenance actions taken and when service was restored.

 The frequency of testing for each instrument is variable but should minimally be monthly. Weekly, daily, or randomly within a monthly cycle is better.  Testing may be made the responsibility of the user(s) the instrument serves providing they document their tests.

Data exfiltration presents a huge vulnerability to any data that is stored within any enterprise and especially sensitive data. The DoD’s data is no less vulnerable. While predominantly an insider threat at this time, as EoIP technology progresses, the bad actors will find external methods to get at and exfiltrate our data through this covert channel that does not require insider activities. 

The traditional pathway to exploit this vulnerability is via a modem and the traditional voice network. The modem was invented to transfer data via the traditional telephone system. A modem can easily be connected to a phone line and a server or workstation (if not already embedded,), a outbound call can be made to an external computer’s modem, and data can flow easily, albeit slowly. To mitigate this threat, we institute both policy and technological mitigations such as specifically authorizing modem use; disabling an embedded modem while its host is connected to a computer network, and others. While modem usage for day-to-day data transfers and network access is dwindling at the enterprise level, many devices today still require the use of a modem. These are FAX machines, traditional secure telephones, and traditional secure VTC systems.  As part of a layered defense against enterprise data exfiltration via a modem; detection, filtering, blocking, and call admission control mechanisms can be placed on traditional telephone switch trunks to detect unauthorized modem traffic and take appropriate action. Generally speaking, all modem traffic should be blocked with permissions established for pre-authorized devices on a specific line-by-line, case-by-case basis. Such technologies exist today.

Today’s technology is taking us swiftly toward a totally converged IP based data and communications network. This can be referred to as Everything over IP (EoIP). As this trend continues the many vulnerabilities and threats that we have been dealing with for years on our data networks are extended to our voice and video communications networks. The threat of sensitive enterprise data exfiltration via the data network is nothing new, and mitigations have been developed to address the various methods and exploits. However, little or nothing has been done to date to address the covert channel through our VoIP communications infrastructure whether connected to a traditional telephone network via a Media Gateway (MG), or to an IP WAN via a Session Border Controller (SBC), or Edge Border Controller (EBC). VVoIP aware firewalls generally address signaling issues and vulnerabilities, but do little to address those of the media streams. 

A data exfiltration exploit using the VVoIP network would look something like this. A trusted insider places a VoIP call from a compromised soft-phone on their workstation to a collection server outside the enterprise network. The call is processed and routed by the VoIP session manager as it would any voice call. The collection server answers the call as if it was a VoIP endpoint; e.g., using another compromised soft-phone. Once the connection is established, a file transfer can occur using the normal RTP streams established for the call as the transport medium. The data transfer is not detected because RTP or SRTP streams are generally not inspected. This is because of a general perception that payload anomalies are undetectable due to the random nature of encoded audio and video signals. SRTP encryption makes the payload inspection task even harder. This scenario easy to implement via IP end to-end-through one or more SBCs/EBCs without any data degradation.  While it has been commonly thought that the transcoding performed in a MG would prevent such an exploit, such an exploit has been demonstrated using a pair of MGs resulting in only minor data degradation. Due to this fact, it is time to be concerned about data exfiltration via the VVoIP infrastructure and implement mitigations to prevent it. 


Today we employ various mitigations that serve to inhibit data exfiltration exploits via VVoIP such as described above. These include but are not limited to the following: 
&gt; Restricting what software can be installed on a server or workstation 
&gt; Restricting what that software can do
&gt; Restricting user to data
&gt; Restricting machine and user access to the network via port security and user authentication
&gt; As well as others

As an additional part of a layered defense against enterprise data exfiltration via the VVoIP network, is to place filters at the VVoIP network egress points, (that is at the MGs and at or within the SBCs/EBCs) that can detect data flows and other anomalies in a RTP/SRTP media stream. Today this is an emerging technology with initial capabilities available today. It is expected that this technology will more robust and mature in the not too distant future.

Emergency communications generally includes requests for fire, police, and/or medical assistance. In DoD, these communications can also include requests for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), explosive ordnance disposal, and similar emergency situations. The inability of first responders to automatically locate the caller threatens life safety and facility protection or security. The ability to call an F&amp;ES telephone number is called Basic F&amp;ES Communications. The ability for the operator answering the emergency call to automatically determine the location of the caller and relay this information to the first responders is called Enhanced F&amp;ES Communications. The ability to contact emergency services via the public telephone system has been mandated for many years in the US and other countries around the world. In the US, the FCC has mandated various aspects of providing enhanced F&amp;ES communications and also relies upon state legislation to extend these rules. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules primarily address public communications service providers including traditional LEC and CLECs, mobile communications providers, and VoIP communications providers. Support for enhanced emergency services communications by private MLTS is left to state legislation. Several states have such legislation today while more states are on the way. Eventually, most, if not all, states will likely have such legislation. Additionally, with respect to the DoD, DoDI 6055.06, DoD Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) Program, December 21, 2006, provides DoD policy regarding emergency services and emergency services communications. While much of this policy addresses fire protection in general and more specifically training, staffing, and equipment, it also provides for telecommunications support for fire, medical, and security emergencies, whether directly or by implication. Several items of interest for this and subsequent STIG requirements are as follows: &gt; 5.8. The Combatant Commanders, through Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall ensure F&amp;ES protection of personnel, equipment, and facilities. &gt; 6.6. Telecommunication Capability. Implement around-the-clock capability to conduct dedicated F&amp;ES communications. &gt; E8.1 Telecommunication Capability; Maintain around-the-clock capability to conduct essential F&amp;ES communications. &gt; E8.1.2. The DoD Components shall implement the installation F&amp;ES alarm and communication function where feasible. &gt; E8.1.2.1. Consolidate with an established continuously manned emergency communications center for all emergency services. &gt; E8.1.2.4. DoD F&amp;ES communications and dispatch functions may be provided by municipal F&amp;ES or other outside agencies when those agencies compare favorably with DoD standards and can meet the prescribed communications criteria. Private telephone systems, in general, provide a large portion of the required telecommunication capability. All DoD telecommunications systems are private MLTS. As such, ALL private MLTS, VoIP or traditional must support enhanced emergency services communications for the completion of emergency calls. Per DoDI 6055.06, all sites must support, provide for, and implement F&amp;ES telecommunications services. When implementing basic F&amp;ES telecommunications services, each country or region designates a specific standard telephone number or prefix code to be dialed that can be easily remembered by the public. In some instances, while not best practice, organizations might designate an internal emergency number for use within their MLTS. PSTN LECs and CLECs must route calls to this number in a non-blocking priority manner. Examples of such numbers are as follows: &gt; 911 in North America &gt; 112 in the EU and UK &gt; 000 in Australia In some cases countries use a separate code for Police vs Medical vs Fire. A rather comprehensive listing can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number. Issues arise when an emergency call is originated through a private phone system, such as a traditional PBX or a VVoIP system. While the LEC or CLEC may properly route the call in a priority manner, the same may not be true for the private system unless specificity addressed in the systems call routing tables and potentially other system features. This is an issue when providing emergency communications services as a best practice or in compliance with governmental mandate. As such, the private system must be configured to properly handle emergency communications. Enhanced F&amp;ES communications permits the answering station to automatically locate the caller. This is particularly helpful when the caller cannot provide their location themselves. Enhanced F&amp;ES communications is generally mandated by the FCC and state legislation. It is today’s state of the art and its implementation is a best practice. The enhanced F&amp;ES communications capability is enabled using Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and Automatic Location Identification (ALI) information. ANI provides the telephone number of the calling party and is generated by the telephone system/switch. ALI associates the calling party’s number (ANI information) with their address, or registered the address/location of the phone being used. ALI is provided by a database function. The database may be maintained within the telephone system/switch or externally. In many cases, the F&amp;ES answering service system will use the ALI information to map the location of the calling phone. ALI information in the public sector is maintained by the telephone service providers and is generally based on billing records. This works fine for traditional phones that have a fixed location at the end of a telephone company wire. VoIP phones, on the other hand, can be connected anywhere in the world and function. This is an issue for commercial VoIP services which is being addressed by the FCC. ALI information in the private sector must be handled by the owners/operators of private MLTS. If a private MLTS is to support enhanced F&amp;ES telecommunications, an ALI database must be instituted and maintained current as instruments and numbers move around a facility or site. While, in many cases, this may be a manual task, automated systems are being developed. NOTE: Notwithstanding system configuration and capabilities, the system must also remain fully functional, minimally for a reasonable time period, in the event primary power is lost. As such, both traditional PBXs and VVoIP systems along with their supporting LAN infrastructure must be provided with sufficient backup power. Specific requirements for voice communications system backup power are addressed in additional requirements. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Loss of life, loss of personal and/or facility safety or security, loss of the facility.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-22297r1_fix">Ensure the site provides for the local DoD Multi-Line Telecommunications System (MLTS), VoIP or traditional, and supports enhanced Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) telecommunications as follows:

These URLs are translated to IP addresses by a DNS server. The use of URLS in this manner permits an endpoint to find the server it is looking for in the event the server’s IP address is changed. This also permits the endpoint to locate its assigned or home call controller from a remote location on a network that is not their home network. While all of this adds flexibility to the system and the endpoint’s location, it also exposes the endpoint and the home system to DNS vulnerabilities. Additionally, the home VVoIP system must expose critical IP address and domain information to the DNS system. If the DNS system is exposed to the DNS servers that support the enterprise data network or the Internet, this information and exposure of the system is, or may be, extended to the world. This provides information that can be used to attack or compromise the VVoIP system. 

When using DNS within a VVoIP system so that endpoints can find various servers in the network, the DNS server should be dedicated to the VVoIP system. Further more this DNS server should have limited or no interaction with the DNS server used by the data portion of the LAN/CAN or a publicly accessible DNS server. This will protect the VVoIP system’s DNS server from some of the vulnerabilities inherent in DNS servers that serve data endpoints and that are connected to the wider enterprise networks or the Internet.

While the use of DNS adds IP addressing flexibility to a VVoIP system, it is not necessary to use it for systems within the local LAN. VVoIP servers and infrastructure devices are required to be statically addressed. Therefore the endpoints can be configured with these known IP addresses rather than URLs. A remote endpoint is required to connect to the home enclave via a VPN. It receives an internal LAN address and therefore becomes a part of the LAN and can directly reach its servers using their IP address. A URL is not required. The only time a URL might be required is in the event the endpoint is required to find a server such as a directory server that is somewhere on the WAN. This is the case in the VoSIP system on SIPRNet. Not using DNS in a VVoIP system eliminates its exposure to DNS vulnerabilities and attacks effected using information obtained from the DNS. 

NOTE: In the event a DNS server is implemented within the VVoIP system, the DNS STIG must be applied to the server.

Additionally legacy telecommunications systems require synchronized time. Network elements (NE). 

The Network Infrastructure STIG provides guidance for using NTP and implementing NTP servers within the enclave or LAN. A paraphrased summary of the basic requirements follows:
&gt; Implement two NTP servers in the LAN management network to act as the source of NTP information to the rest of the enclave/LAN.
&gt; Reference the two NTP servers to two different stratum 1 reference clocks via GPS or NIST WWVB.
&gt; Harden NTP servers in accordance with the applicable OS STIG.
&gt; Distribute NTP information to all LAN NEs via the management interface. This provides a protected environment for the distribution of network time.
&gt; All received and sent messages between NTP peers are authenticated.

NOTE: This list is not complete and is provided as information only. Refer to the current Network Infrastructure STIG for all policy and requirements associated with NTP use and implementation in the LAN. 

The VVoIP system must be synchronized with the LAN time, minimally to support troubleshooting and incident response. Therefore the VVoIP system must be integrated into the LAN’S NTP system in accordance with the Network Infrastructure STIG NTP guidance. Its network time must not be synchronized with an independent source. 

Additionally, if the VVoIP system is synchronized with an independent source via the Internet, the VVoIP system becomes exposed to NTP exploits and attacks from the Internet.

Implementing NTP within the VVoIP system will require the system/call controller to be configured to receive authenticated NTP messages from the two NTP server IP addresses via its management interface. This will require that permissions be granted between the VVoIP management VLAN and the LAN management VLAN such that NTP requests and responses can flow between the VVoIP system controller and the two NTP servers in the LAN management VLAN. If the VVoIP endpoints time is synchronized via NTP, the VVoIP controller will have to serve as their NTP server since the endpoints do not have access to the VVoIP or LAN management VLANs and should not be permitted such access.
