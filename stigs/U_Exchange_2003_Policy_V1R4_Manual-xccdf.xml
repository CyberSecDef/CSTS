Front-end/back-end architecture provides for logical separation of protocols, user traffic, and the subsequent ability to secure each of these aspects of E-Mail technology using discrete security techniques that are appropriate for each. 

In this architecture, a front-end server accepts requests from clients and proxies them to the appropriate back-end server for processing and offloads the SSL encryption The term "back-end server" refers to all servers in an organization that are not front-end servers after a front-end server is introduced into the organization.   

In a multi-server environment, one or more back-end servers may be cast in the role of ‘Bridgehead’ server.  Bridgehead servers are used in large domains that deploy mailbox servers in multiple locations, sometimes spanning wide area network (WAN) (or other slow) connections, or require careful bandwidth management for other reasons. Bridgehead servers work in pairs, one at each side of a location, to manage replication and distribution tasks.   

The primary advantage of the front-end/back-end server architecture is the ability to expose a single, consistent namespace to end users, for example, https://mail.mycompany.com.  Without a front-end server, users must know the name of the server that stores their mailbox.

Microsoft names three roles for E-mail administration as a starting point (appearing in diminishing order):  E-mail Full Administrator, E-mail Administrator, and E-Mail View-Only Administrator.  Because Exchange 2003 is an application, all three roles are subordinate to OS Administrator roles.   

E-mail Full Administrator has the ability to install the application and configure the access and operational parameters, perform user and configuration setup, and view all aspects of E-mail configuration and performance.   The Exchange Installation account would be a good candidate for this group. 

E-mail Administrator is able to perform user and configuration setup, and view all aspects of e-mail configuration and performance.  Operational tasks and administrators would be good candidates for this role. 

E-mail View-Only Administrator is able to view all aspects of E-mail configuration and performance.  Persons or utilities that monitor throughput, connector, and queue performance would be a good candidate for this group. 

Further granularity is possible, and often makes sense to do, enabling each role to operate using the least possible permissions to perform the role.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt; &lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECPA-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><fixtext fixref="F-19470r1_fix">Procedure:  Create, or have created, Policies / OUs / Security Groups to define roles and permissions for the E-mail Administration team.

However, audit record collection may quickly overwhelm storage resources and an auditor’s ability to review it in a productive manner.  Add to that, an audit trail that is not monitored for detection of suspicious activities provides little value.  Regular or daily review of audit logs not only leads to the earliest possible notice of a compromise, but can also minimize the extent of the compromise.  

Automated Log Monitoring gives the additional boost to the monitoring process, in that noteworthy events are more immediately detected, provided they have been defined to the automated monitoring process.  Log data can be mined for specific events, and upon detection, they can be analyzed and summarized by such tools to provide choices for alert methods, reports, trend analyses, attack scenario solutions.  &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt; &lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECRG-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><fixtext fixref="F-19576r1_fix">Procedure:  Ensure that automated tools are implemented and available for review and reporting on E-mail Service audit records.</fixtext><fix id="F-19576r1_fix" /><check system="C-22523r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Email Services Policy.xml" /><check-content>Interview the IAO or the E-mail administrator.

Since 2006, Microsoft best practices had taken the direction of creating operational “roles” for servers within E-mail services.  The Edge Transport server role (also called the E-mail Secure Gateway) was created to focus authentication and sanitization tasks in one server, to provide Internet facing protection for internal E-mail servers.   Microsoft Exchange 2003 does not offer the Edge Transport server role.  

In the E-mail services infrastructure, it has become imperative that inbound messages be examined prior to their being forwarded into the enclave, primarily due to the amount of SPAM and malware contained in the message stream.  Similarly, outbound messages must be examined so that an organization might locate, or perhaps intercept, messages with potential data spillage of sensitive or important information.  The Edge Transport E-mail server role, which includes ‘appliances’ such as “Iron Port”, “Iron Mail” and the like, is designed to group protective measures for both inbound and outbound messages. Its charter is to face the Internet, and to scrutinize all SMTP traffic, to determine whether to grant continued passage to its destination 

Inbound E-mail sanitization steps include (but are not limited to) the following: 
•	Sender Authentication
•	Sender Reputation Evaluation (White-listing and Black-listing)
•	SPAM content scoring
•	Virus and Malware removal
•	Web Link URL evaluation
•	Absent sender information 
•	SPOOFED domain sources (such as the local domain appearing as inbound mail)
•	0-Day attack detection
•	Archiving or Quarantining trapped messages
•	Alerting and Reporting when configured items are identified. 

Failure to implement an E-mail Secure Gateway increases risk that raw messages will reach the internal servers and networks, thereby increasing risk of their compromise.  Even though Exchange 2003 E-mail Services are able to perform many of these evaluations, their Windows domain membership requires that they be internal to the enclave rather than expose the domain interaction to the Public Internet.  Attempting to sanitize E-mail after it arrives inside the domain is not longer an acceptable or effective security measure.  By using an Edge Transport Server (E-mail Secure Gateway),  any SMPT-specific attack vectors are more optimally secured.

Ensure that all inbound and outbound E-mail messages are routed through the gateway. </check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-19548"><title>EMG3-108 Web Application Proxy Implemented</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-21613r1_rule" severity="high"><version>EMG3-108 Exch2K3</version><title>E-mail web services are not protected by having an application proxy server outside the enclave.   </title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Separation of roles supports operational security for application and protocol services.  The HTTP path to web sites is a proven convenience in requiring only a browser to access them, but is simultaneously a well known attack vector for people and applications that would attempt to gain unwelcome admittance. 

Web-based applications such as Exchange 2003 Outlook Web Access (OWA) reside on Windows domain Member Servers, and are classified as ‘internal’, or private web servers.  In order for the DoD to grant web-based access to E-mail services, careful authentication, encryption, and other precautions are needed.  

Authentication, via Common Access Card, is not a feature of Exchange 2003.  Add to that, it is risky to admit Internet-sourced web traffic, even with SSL or TLS encryption, into the enclave without some inspection, such as for suspicious URL formation.  Also, ensuring that only the desired protocols are allowed reduces risk as well as excess traffic.  

An application proxy server, such as Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) server is an effective firewall and proxy that offers all of these features when properly equipped and configured.  Failure to require CAC authentication of each user, a new security context for the transaction, and FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption for the Internet leg of the transaction, all increase risk of compromise to the OWA web server.         &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt; &lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;EBBD-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><fixtext fixref="F-20244r1_fix">Procedure:  Install an application proxy server capable of authenticating a CAC-enabled transaction, continue the transaction in a new security context, and require FIPS 140-2 encryption for the Internet connection to the end user.  </fixtext><fix id="F-20244r1_fix" /><check system="C-23796r1_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Email Services Policy.xml" /><check-content>For sites not using Exchange 2003 E-mail web services, this check is N/A. 

Procedure:  Interview the IAO.  Access documentation that describes the E-mail services infrastructure.  Verify that a proxy server such as Microsoft ISA server 2006 is  installed and requires CAC authentication, is a member of the local Windows domain, and initiates a new security context for the transaction.  

Criteria:  If the site employs an application proxy server such as Microsoft ISA, that requires CAC authentication, FIPS 140-2 encryption, and URL evaluation, this is not a finding.  </check-content></check></Rule></Group></Benchmark>
