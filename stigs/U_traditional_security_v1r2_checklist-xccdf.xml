The new Traditional Security Checklist consolidates all checks into one document and is more granular both in the increased number of checks (151 total versus 96 total in the old checklists) and the details about how to conduct them.  It provides a more complete and current list of references, the relationship and authority for checks relative to protection of Defense Information System Network (DISN) assets, and will enhance reviewer consistency with application of potential findings.
 
While the number of potential findings have increased and are more focused to a specific check there is additional granularity within each check.  In many of the primary checks there are additional considerations and "sub-checks".  As the new checklist is further developed it may be that some of these sub-checks will become additional stand-alone primary checks.

The format and content flow of the new checklist is like other Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) checklists derived from the Vulnerability Management System (VMS) database, which is used by DISA FSO, the Combatant Commands, Services, and Agencies (CC/S/A) and other Federal Agencies with access to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) to document and follow-up findings noted during Command Cyber Readiness Inspections (CCRIs).

Keyed crypto equipment must be housed within a proper GSA safe, vault or secure room. 2. If crypto equipment is not housed within a proper GSA safe, vault or secure room the Crypto Encryption Key must be removed and stored in a GSA approved safe or in a separate room from the crypto equipment when the equipment is not under the continuous observation and control of a properly cleared person. 3.

Obviously an initial inspection cannot ever be conducted once it is not completed.  Therefore the fix for this finding is to send a written request to the PDS approval authority asking for an "initial" inspection of the PDS by an individual appointed by the approval authority. If the approval authority concurs to conduct the inspection then this finding can be closed once the inspection is actually completed and any results form that inspection are closed.   If the reply from the approval authority indicates they will not complete their "required" inspection then then finding can be closed and the reply from the approval authority should be maintained for future reference. </fixtext><fix id="F-34789r3_fix" /><check system="C-39641r3_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Traditional.xml" /><check-content>Check to ensure the PDS was inspected prior to initial operation.

1. Written procedures must be developed that cover the requirements and process for Visit Authorization Letters (VAL) for contractors visiting and/or employed at government sites. 

2. All government sites must have a VAL on file for each contractor visiting the site temporarily and also for permanent party contractors routinely working/physically employed at the site.  

Notes: 

JPAS should be used for most short term "visitor" VALs; however, in addition to JPAS (or as an alternative to JPAS for contractors who do not have JPAS accounts) VALs may also be passed via hard copy or electronically using email (mail, fax, email) for "assigned" contractor employees.  This is because JPAS is by design intended for short term visits; whereas, contractor  "employee" VALs require additional information (such as contract number, COR identification, etc.) that cannot be input or passed via JPAS.  

A hard copy VAL for assigned contractor employees will help to eliminate substantive confusion over the company Facility Clearance Level (FCL), individual contract employee security clearance levels, IT position assignments based on job descriptions (found in applicable Statements of Work (SOW and/or DD 254), etc.   </fixtext><fix id="F-34806r4_fix" /><check system="C-39661r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="I" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Traditional.xml" /><check-content>Checks:

1. Check with the security manager or personnel security specialists to ensure there are written procedures for  contractors visiting government sites. 

2. Ask to see copies of the site VALs and/or determine site VAL process based on the processing of contractors on your inspection team.  

3. Ensure all government facilities have a VAL on file for all contractors visiting the site - to include permanent party contractors.  

Notes: 

1. JPAS should and will likely be used for most short term "visitor" VALs; however, in addition to JPAS the VAL may also be passed via hard copy or electronically using email (mail, fax, email) for "assigned" contractor employees.  This is because JPAS is by design intended for short term visits; whereas, contractor  "employee" VALs should require additional information (such as contract number, COR identification, etc.) that cannot be input or passed via JPAS.  Lack of a hard copy VAL alone for assigned contractor employees at a site will not necessarily be cause for a finding if a VAL in JPAS is available.  Reviewers must use discretion when evaluating if the lack of hard copy VAL has caused any substantive confusion over the company Facility Clearance Level (FCL), individual contract employee security clearance levels, IT position assignments based on job descriptions (found in applicable Statements of Work (SOW and/or DD 254), etc. when deciding if a finding is warranted. For instance an individual employee's JPAS access might indicate they have TS clearance - but the FCL for the company is only at the Secret level and/or the contract only allows for up to Secret access.  If the site is allowing access to TS for this individual - then the lack of a hard copy VAL could be cited as a finding, in addition to any other related findings for this discovery.

2. Applies in a tactical environment if contract personnel visit or are assigned.

3. Reviewers should be sure to note in the findings report if the finding concerns JPAS issues for short term contractor visitors or if it concerns "hard copy" VALs for assigned contractor employees.

1. For Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III systems only:  If a COOP or Disaster Recovery Plan is not in place, ensure the DAA has considered and accepted the risk (specifically for lack of COOP) in a Risk Assessment.   

2. Check COOP documentation for plan testing, discrepancies noted and if corrective action taken. 

3. Conduct a cursory review of the COOP to ensure it is commensurate with the MAC Level of the system concerning recovery times and testing requirement(s). 

NOTES: 

1. Certain large computing centers like the DISA Computing Services (DECCs) may offer COOP as a fee for service option.  Since this is applicable to "customer" applications it should not be a finding attributed to the DECC.  If appropriate, COOP or lack thereof if cited as a finding in this instance should be attributed to the specific customer.  

2. This requirement should not be applied to a tactical environment, unless it is a fixed computer facility supporting operations within a Theater of Operations.  The standards to be applied for applicability in a tactical environment are:  1) The facility containing the computer room has been in operation over 1-year. 2) The facility is "fixed facility" - a hard building made from normal construction materials - wood, steel, brick, stone, mortar, etc.

Two alternatives exist for check #1 in lieu of storage in a classified (secret or higher) vault, secure room or a SCIF:

a. Information Processing System (IPS) containers are safes designed to house operational Information Systems (IS) equipment and can be used to meet this requirement. The use of an IPS container is often a good recommendation when a deficiency is found.

b. A second alternative is to house network equipment in a 24/7 continuously occupied room or area.  When using this method of control the equipment must be under the continuous (physical) observation and control of the cleared occupants. If using this alternative the network equipment must be maintained in lockable equipment storage cabinets.  This is to ensure that only Network Administrators and other (authorized) personnel are the only persons with unimpeded access to the Network Connections.  If the equipment is under continuous observation and control but not in a lockable cabinet or otherwise maintained to ensure that only Network Administrators and other(authorized) personnel have access, then it will be a CAT II finding under check #2 below.

DETAILED EXPLANATION FOLLOWS:
1.  The primary and most basic requirement (IAW the Network Policy found in the Layer 2 Switch STIG - Cisco) is implementation of IEEE port authentication standard 802.1X (logical software based port security) - regardless of the physical area or space in which the wall jacks/ports are located.  TRADITIONAL SECURITY REVIEWERS MUST FIRST CHECK WITH THE NETWORK REVIEWER to determine if 802.1X has been properly implemented on SIPRNet before evaluating the physical security of SIPRNet Wall Jacks. * Do this early in your site visit so that wall jack physical security considerations can be properly evaluated during your site tour/walk around.

2.  Not using 802.1X based port authentication on SIPRNet is a CAT I *Network STIG” finding, separate from any traditional security considerations.  However, if 802.1X is not implemented there is another software based alternative, which is the Network STIG requirement to allow for "legacy" port security via MAC address.  Several caveats go with this alternative and this is when the physical security mitigations are required to be implemented:  

    a.  Use of simple MAC port security rather than 802.1X will result in a CAT III (*Network STIG) finding (on NIPRNet or SIPRNet).  While this is not a traditional security check, it is something to be aware of.

    b.  If simple MAC port security rather than 802.1X is implemented *on SIPRNet* (OR IF THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL SOFTWARE BASED PORT SECURITY), the traditional security considerations and mitigations required IAW the Access Control STIG are as follows:  

       (1)  If the wall jacks/drops/ports are located within spaces properly established as Secret or TS vaults or Secret or TS Secure Rooms (AKA: Collateral Classified Open Storage Areas) OR within an approved SCIF, then there is no requirement for supplemental physical security measures.  Again - No supplemental physical security controls are required for SIPRNet wall jacks in these areas.  

     (2)  If the wall jacks are not located in Secret or higher secure room/vault/SCIF, the following physical security controls must be in place:

          (a)  SIPRNet wall jacks must be secured *when not attended by persons with Secret or higher clearance* by a properly constructed lock box (Hoffman or similar commercial product or locally fabricated).  The lock box must be 18-gauge steel or better and have no exposed or removable hinges (internal hinges are ideal).  If used, external hinge pins must be peened, welded, etc. so they cannot be removed without evidence of forced removal.  Hasp hardware must be riveted to the box or otherwise installed so that removal will require physical breaking of the box or hasp, thereby leaving evidence of actual or attempted entry.  No pre-punch (knock-out) holes are allowed in the box.  The lock box must be secured with a 3-position high security combination padlock (IAW the NSTISSI 7003 standard for PDS "Pull Boxes").  The S&amp;G 8077 combination padlock is the ONLY existing combo padlock meeting this standard.  See the DoD Lock Program site for details: 

https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/portal/page/portal/navfac/navfac_ww_pp/navfac_nfesc_pp/locks/CM_LOCKS/CL_PADLOCK/TAB_PADLOCK_PROD

          (b)  If lock boxes are not used the alternative is to physically disconnect the hot SIPRNet transmission lines at the SIPRNet Point of Presence (PoP) after normal duty hours.  The PoP must be located within a proper Secret or higher secure room or vault or SCIF.

NOTE 1:  To reiterate the basic requirement:  If IEEE 802.1X is properly implemented at the switch to authenticate devices *with clients (such as user work stations)* no additional supplemental physical security controls are required for the wall jacks.  VERIFICATION FOR 802.1X IMPLEMENTATION MUST BE COORDINATED WITH THE NETWORK REVIEWER.

Note 2:  Regardless of Port Authentication using IEEE 802.1X, *clientless devices (such as printers, scanners or multi-functional devices (MFD)* cannot be authenticated - but this should not cause an issue with needing supplemental physical controls (lock box or disconnect at PoP).  The reason is because clientless devices like these that are connected to SIPRNet should “normally” be maintained in a Secret/TS secure room or vault or SCIF and therefore would not require supplemental physical security of the wall jacks.  Otherwise, MFD wall jacks must be protected by lock boxes or physical disconnect at the PoP after normal duty hours.  Additional physical security measures or procedures for protection of classified MFD hard drives, residual images and printed materials will also be required, but these considerations are addressed elsewhere on the checklist. 

Note 3:  Do not confuse the STIG wall jack lock box requirement with the NISTISSI 7003 lock box requirement on the physical end point (Termination Boxes) of a Protected Distribution System (PDS).  The reference for PDS is the NSTISSI 7003, not the Access Control STIG. The requirements for PDS (pull-boxes, Access Points or Termination Boxes) and wall jack (lock boxes) are totally separate and unique, although it is possible to find the end of a PDS terminating in a lock box - that ALSO fulfills the requirement for protection of a wall jack where 802.1X is not implemented.  

NOTE 4:  If there is no "legacy" MAC port security in place  there will be a CAT I port security finding written by the Network reviewer.  If the traditional security reviewer also finds a CAT I finding for lack of physical security protective measures there is a CCRI scoring over ride that will decrease the OVERALL CCRI score. So where there is absolutely no logical or physical port/wall jack security in place - the result is very severe in terms of the CCRI score.  Traditional Security reviewers, Network Reviewers (and Team Leads) need to be aware of this because of its significance to the site being reviewed.

3. Proper key control procedures must be in place for associated keys used to secure doors to communications rooms AND equipment cabinets. 

NOTE: Because locks and keys to equipment cabinets are often inferior and do not provide for adequate physical protection it is recommended that a metal hasp be attached (using rivets or other means that cannot be removed without evidence of forceable entry) to equipment cabinets securing network equipment.  General Services Administration (GSA) Medium Security Keyed Padlocks or (preferably) the S&amp;G 8077 Changeable Combination Padlock should then be used to secure the cabinet using the hasp.</fixtext><fix id="F-35098r4_fix" /><check system="C-39920r5_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Traditional.xml" /><check-content>1.

Failure to limit and control physical access to information visible on system monitor screens, information processing equipment containing classified data, removable storage media and printed documents is especially important in mixed US/FN environments.  Inadequate access and procedural controls can result in FN personnel having unauthorized access to classified materials and data, which can result in the loss or compromise of classified information, including NOFORN information. 
   
Appropriate but simple physical and procedural security measures must be put in place to ensure the FN partners do not have unauthorized access to information not approved for release to them. 

The primary control measure is to either keep US Only classified documents, information systems equipment and/ or associated removable storage media under continuous observation and control of a cleared US employee or place such items in an approved safe when unattended.

Additionally, escorting  visitors AND all FN employees/personnel into any area where there is US Only classified processing, documents, media, equipment or materials is not only a prudent security measure but an absolute requirement to prevent both intentional (insider threat) or unintentional (inadvertent) unauthorized exposure to classified materials and information.
 
Following are applicable excerpts from CJCSI 6510.01F pertaining to control of US Only workstation spaces (in particular SCIFs and secure rooms):

7. Information and Information System Access.  Access to DOD ISs is a revocable privilege and shall be granted to individuals based on need-to-know and IAW DODI 8500.2, NSTISSP No. 200, “National Policy on Controlled Access Protection” , Status of Forces Agreements for host national access, and DOD 5200.2-R, “Personnel Security System”.
b. Individual foreign nationals may be granted access to specific classified U.S. networks and systems as specifically authorized under Information Sharing guidance outlined in changes to National Disclosure Policy (NDP-1).  
(1) Classified ISs shall be sanitized or configured to guarantee that foreign nationals have access only to classified information that has been authorized for disclosure to the foreign national’s government or coalition, and is necessary to fulfill the terms of their assignments.
(2) U.S.-only classified workstations shall be under strict U.S. control at all times.
27. Foreign Access.
f. Foreign National Access to U.S.-Only Workstations and Network Equipment. CC/S/As shall:
(1) Maintain strict U.S. control of U.S.-only workstations and network equipment at all times.
(4) Announce presence. If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times. In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.
&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;Severity Override:
The default severity level is Category I and there is no mitigation allow to a lower severity level.
This check is to assess physical access control measures and control and internal control procedures for classified information system equipment and removable storage media in areas in which there are US Only terminals/monitors/documents/media or other US Only system/network equipment.  Even though there may also be terminals/monitors/documents/media or other system/network equipment present in the same area to which FN have been granted access, the fact the FN do not have access to the US Only equipment requires that the FN are not granted unescorted physical access to such areas.

Therefore, if there are absolutely no US Only classified / sensitive work stations, monitors, documents or media in an area (with FN presence) and the FN employee or partner has been granted access to all systems in the physical environment - then this requirement is NA and should be annotated to the VMS report as Not a Finding.

This requirement is also NA if there is no routine FN presence in the classified work area.
&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;RELATED VULS (STIG ID):

1.  STIG ID: FN-05.02.01.  This requirement is specifically focused on checking written policy/procedures and initial/recurring training concerning US employee interactions with FN employees assigned to the organization OR frequent and recurring FN visitors.  Even if there are procedures and training a finding may still be written when it is clear from interviews and observation of the environment by traditional security reviewers that a lack of employee understanding of the rules and procedures are evident and are not being exercised.

2.  STIG ID: IS-08.01.01.  Classified Monitors/Displays (Physical Control of Classified Monitors From Unauthorized Viewing) .  This requirement is specifically focused on checking physical controls in place to protect classified work stations (monitor screens) from unauthorized viewing.  This requirement includes positioning and control of classified monitors and covers environments where Foreign Nationals are present and US Only work stations/monitor screens are present.
 
3.  STIG ID: IS-08.03.01.  This requirement is specifically focused on checking written policy/procedures and initial/recurring training concerning cleared employee responsibilities and actions to protect classified work stations (monitor screens) under their control from unauthorized viewing.  This requirement includes positioning and control of classified monitors and covers environments containing  US Only work stations/monitor screens where Foreign Nationals are present.  

4.  STIG ID: IS-08.01.02.  This requirement concerns maintaining control of Common Access Cards (CACs), SIPRNet tokens and locking of computer work stations/monitor screens when unattended by removal of CACs, SIPRNet tokens or using Clt/Alt/Del.  This requirement includes environments containing  US Only work stations/monitor screens where Foreign Nationals are present.

Motion detection located interior to secure rooms provides the most complete/overarching coverage of any Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarm sensor.  While most sensors like BMS alarm contacts, glass break detectors, etc. are only able to detect potential intrusion at specific locations, use of motion detection provides a capability to protect large areas with "blanket coverage" generally using fewer sensors.  This capability need not cover the entire secure room space (although that would be best) but can be used effectively by placement directly over the protected assets or in hallways or other restricted passage ways leading to classified/sensitive assets.  Consolidating classified information system assets in specific spaces within secure rooms enables a more efficient use of motion detectors and ensures the most critical assets are properly protected.

This fix is concerned with ensuring there is periodic visual validation of structural integrity of secure room/collateral classified open storage area perimeters containing SIPRNet assets and associated media.  It ensures that any breach or attempted breach of the walls, true floors and true ceilings of a secure area (which are not readily visible) are discovered in a timely manner.

In requirement #1 there are 3 different situations covered and each requires a different level of physical/visual validation for structural integrity. 
 
Requirement #1. Structural integrity of secure rooms or spaces containing SIPRNet equipment must be validated in each situation as follows: 
 
Situation #1 (No structural integrity checks required): If interior IDS (motion detection) is *properly employed (*directly covering all SIPRNet assets) within the secure room or collateral classified open storage space where classified SIPRNet assets are located AND under raised floor spaces (if applicable) AND above suspended ceiling spaces (if applicable), then no physical check for structural integrity is required.  This is contingent upon the interior motion sensors being activated when the room is closed or unattended, and that the sensors work properly as determined by required checks of sensor functionality.
  
Situation #2 (Monthly checks required): If motion sensors are properly employed ONLY within the secure room space where classified assets are located, then a visual check of spaces below raised floor, above suspended ceilings and anywhere else the perimeter of the secure area cannot be readily observed must be conducted on at least a monthly basis.  The goal is to visually inspect all walls, true floor and true ceiling perimeters for signs of breach or attempted breach.
   
Situation #3 (Weekly checks required): When random checks (not exceeding 4-hours) of secure rooms or open storage spaces are used in lieu of IDS then the checks specified in situation #2 for above suspended ceilings and below raised floors must be conducted at least weekly.  The increased frequency of checks is due to the significant vulnerability of the SIPRNet assets to undetected attack from portions of the perimeter that cannot be readily observed.  NOTE: Physical inspection of the perimeter walls, floor and ceiling can be greatly expedited and may be conducted without ladders or other equipment where there are no false/suspended ceilings and/or raised floors within or surrounding the secure room or area.   

Requirement #2. There must be written procedures developed for the checks and that the checks are documented and maintained on file for a minimum of 90 days.  Where discrepancies (holes in perimeter or other signs of successful or attempted access) are noted these checks will be maintained indefinitely or until an inquiry determines the cause of the discrepancy.

In spite of all physical security defensive devices deployed, the possibility of an intrusion always exists. The highest fence can be scaled, the most dense wall can be breached and the stoutest lock can be compromised.  Even highly sophisticated alarm systems can be contravened by a knowledgeable professional.  It is therefore necessary to institute a system of checks to physically inspect secure perimeters to check for signs of attempted intrusions and ensure that structural integrity of the perimeter is maintained. 

This requirement is concerned with ensuring there is periodic visual validation of structural integrity of secure room/collateral classified open storage area perimeters containing SIPRNet assets and associated media.  It ensures that any breach or attempted breach of the walls, true floors and true ceilings of a secure area (which are not readily visible) are discovered in a timely manner.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure to meet standards for ensuring that there is structural integrity of the physical perimeter surrounding a secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) IAW DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3 could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.

Using a physical intrusion detection system enables immediate detection of attempted and/or actual intrusion into a secure room space.  This is often the best supplemental protective measure (vice using 4-hour random checks) due to providing capability for immediate detection, and for immediate response to assess and counter the threat to the secure room space.  Use of 4-hour checks may be adequate if supported by a risk assessment, but will not provide the immediate detection and response capability of a properly installed IDS.  It is required that a risk assessment be conducted to determine which of these two intrusion detection methods (use of IDS OR 4-hour random checks) is appropriate for any particular location.  If the risk assessment results in a determination that use of 4-hour random checks is the most cost efficient supplemental control (vice IDS) to protect SIPRNet assets contained in secure rooms, the manner in which the checks are conducted can greatly impact the effectiveness of the checks.  Thorough physical checks conducted on a frequent basis can reduce the time between an attempted or actual intrusion and time of discovery - during random checks. 
&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;The default severity level for a finding is Category I (CAT I):  A site does not employ IDS for protection of secret secure rooms protecting SIPRNet assets and random guard checks not to exceed 4-hours are not *properly conducted*.  

A proper check of the secure room or area will consist of ensuring all doors, ground level windows capable of being opened, and openings exceeding 96 square inches are checked.  Physical Checks will ensure doors, windows and openings are still locked and/or supplemental security measures (bars, grills, etc. are still intact).  Checks MUST BE made on a RANDOM basis rather than just once every 4-hours to be proper and effective.  

A Documented Record of all checks must be made and maintained on file for 90 days for checks to be considered proper.  

If use of random checks is not supported by both a risk assessment and a security-in-depth determination in writing  by the Agency (C/S/A) senior security official is not available - this is also a CAT I finding.  

If guards or employees conducting the checks do not have at least a Secret clearance this is not a proper check and is a CAT I finding.

Downgrade to CAT II:  If random checks are properly conducted:
1. but documented procedures are not provided for checkers to follow OR
2. a record of checks is not maintained.

This requirement/check (random checks) is Not Applicable (NA) if IDS is used as the supplemental control.

This requirement, 4-hour random checks (IS-02.01.10) cannot be used together with the requirement/check for IDS (IS-02.01.07).  Only one or the other is applicable to any individual secure room or collateral classified open storage area.&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;

This requirement is concerned with using random checks as the required supplemental control of secure room/collateral classified open storage area space (containing SIPRNet assets) - instead of IDS.  

Fixes:

1. Use of random checks in lieu of IDS must be supported by a valid risk assessment (addressing each secure room or area) that specifically considers the threat, vulnerabilities, security-in-depth countermeasures, acceptability of risk, potential cost savings, procedural requirements, and potential cost of additional manpower associated with random checks of the secure areas - as an alternative to IDS.  

2. The frequency of random checks must not exceed 4-hours when the secure area space is not attended. 

3. Checks must be conducted by guards/employees who are cleared to at least the Secret level.  

4. Checks must be conducted of each door (primary and all secondary), each window, and each opening exceeding 96 square inches (which are required to be protected with either bars, expanded metal grills, commercial metal sounds baffles) to ensure they are properly secured.  Additionally all traversable space surrounding the exterior of the Secure Room must be viewed by the checker by walking around the entire perimeter.  

5.  Checks must be supported by written procedures/instructions for the checkers and results of checks must be recorded.  

6. Locally developed checklists or the Standard Form (SF) 701 must be used to document checks.  Completed checklists should be maintained on-hand for at least 90-days as an audit trail or indefinitely if discrepancies were noted during any checks.

It is important to note that random checks are an allowable alternative to IDS *ONLY* if supported by a valid risk assessment AND security-in-depth countermeasures as determined in writing by the C/S/A senior security official.  Otherwise not meeting this requirement will result in a finding.

This particular check (random checks of secure rooms) is Not Applicable (NA) if IDS is used.  

In summary this check must validate that random checks not exceeding 4-hours are being used AND that it is supported by a valid risk assessment along with security-in-depth countermeasures.

Protection must be established and maintained for all component devices or equipment that constitute the entry/access control system (ACS) and/or the intrusion detection system (IDS) used to protect a vault, secure room or collateral classified open storage area, which contains SIPRNet assets.

If access to a junction box or controller will enable an unauthorized modification, then alarmed tamper protection, which is normally provided by a pressure sensitive switch must be used.  

Fixes:

1.  IDS/ACS components located both outside and inside the secure area must have tamper protection resulting in an alarm signal sent to the primary IDS Monitoring Station.  Normally this is provided by a pressure sensitive switch, which automatically sends an alarm signal when the protective enclosure covering component equipment is opened. 

2. ALL IDS/ACS ancillary equipment such as card readers, keypads, communication or interface devices for vaults, secure rooms, or collateral classified open storage areas containing SIPRNet assets must have tamper resistant enclosures and be securely fastened to the wall or other permanent structure.  Control panels and ACS devices located within a Secret or TS Controlled Access Area (CAA) need only a minimal degree of physical security protection sufficient to preclude unauthorized access to the mechanism.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Failure to control door access to a Continuous Operations Facility containing classified SIPRNET assets may result in immediate and potentially undetected access to classified information, with no capability to immediately alert response forces.  Ultimately this could result in the undetected loss or compromise of classified material.

USE CASE EXPLANATION:

A Continuous Operations Facility functions 24/7 and contains classified SIPRNet equipment and/or media that does not meet all the physical and procedural requirements of a vault or secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area) and the classified equipment and/or media may not be stored in an approved safe when not in use.  Examples of such facilities are Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), Information System Monitoring Centers, Trouble Desk Centers, etc.  All standards for Continuous Operations Facilities are found in the DoD Manual 5200.01, V3 and this STIG Requirement provides additional clarification and implementation standards for all Continuous Operations Facilities containing SIPRNet assets.

Continuous Operations Facilities are not routinely closed and secured after normal business hours and reopened at the beginning of normal workdays.   A Continuous Operations Facility is either continuously occupied or receives frequent access (several times during an 8 hour shift).  A “facility” can be a single room or a larger contiguous area, usually (but not always) without Federal Specification FF-L-2740 combination locks on the primary access door.  Continuous Operations area access must meet the requirements herein even where the surrounding area is continuously occupied.  Continuous Operations minimizes or eliminates the need for certain other security measures such as door locks, IDS, etc.

Where there is a Continuous Operations Facility there should be demonstrated need for continuous occupation or frequent access to the “specific” room or area containing the classified SIPRNet assets.  A justification that the surrounding building or facility is continuously occupied is not acceptable.  If this is observed, reviewers should consider the possibility that the stated requirement for a Continuous Operations Facility is being used to cover deficiencies with what should legitimately be established as a secure room or vault.  In such cases the use of Traditional Security STIG Requirements and applicable standards for vaults and/or secure rooms may be more appropriate, resulting in findings under those Requirements.

A Continuous Operations Facility containing classified materials is most appropriate when it is continuously occupied by properly cleared employees (or others with security clearance and a need-to-know) who are capable of controlling or monitoring ingress and egress from within the area.  This provides the most legitimate justification for using a Continuous Operations Facility vice using a properly constructed and access controlled vault or secure room (AKA: collateral classified open storage area).

Alternatively (and less desirable from a security perspective) the area may not be continuously occupied but access is required on a very frequent basis by cleared employees.  The frequency of access makes opening and closing of the area impractical.  So while there is not an absolute rule, if such a room or area is not routinely accessed for operational reasons several times during a standard 8-hour shift the justification for not constructing and securing it in accordance with requirements for a secure room or vault is unacceptable.  Convenience and ease of access is not proper justification for a Continuous Operations Facility.

Continuous Operations area door control may be accomplished multiple ways.  The five main types of access control methods are listed below.  One or more of the five methods may apply to any site.  Each access point must comply with one or more of the methods of access control for 24 hours of each day.  Any deficiency for any area access point or for a portion of the day for an access point will result in a finding under this item.  All Continuous Operations Facilities access points should be checked for proper access control according to the type of access control methods implemented.
Direct access control monitoring for both occupied and unoccupied Continuous Operations Facilities is conducted by:  cleared employees, guards or receptionists located inside the area or directly outside the area.  A properly configured Automated Entry Control System (AECS) or continuously monitored Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) are the only options for indirect monitoring of Continuous Operations Facilities.

The five basic methods for controlling access to Continuous Operations Facilities are:

1.  Method #1: Use of an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) Card Reader with Biometrics or Personal Identification Number (PIN)

2.  Method #2:  Access Continually Monitored by Occupants (Cleared Employees) of the Continuous Operations Facility - all doors NOT visible

3.  Method #3:  Access Monitored by Occupants (Cleared Employees) of the Continuous Operations Facility - all doors are visible

4.  Method #4:  Access Monitored by Employees Directly Outside the Open Storage Space - all doors MUST BE visible

5.  Method #5:  Access Monitored by Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) reporting to a Central Monitoring Station Staffed 24/7 by cleared Guards or Other cleared Security Professionals - all doors MUST HAVE CCTV cameras

Normally only one method of access control will be applicable to a specific Continuous Operations Facility; however, there may be situations where more than one approved method is being used at a single facility.  For instance an Automated Entry Control System (AECS) with card reader and PIN may be used to secure the access door while there are also employees located inside the room who can monitor and control access.  In situations where multiple methods are found, reviewers should choose only one of the five to evaluate compliance and the effectiveness of access control to the Continuous Operations Facility.  If one of the methods is found to be totally compliant while others in use contain deficiencies, the method that is 100% compliant should be selected for use during the review.  In the example just provided, if the room is only occupied by one employee who during breaks or for other reasons must exit the room for periods of time this would cause a significant deficient condition since the room is not continuously occupied by an employee.  Therefore using the AECS as the method to evaluate access control for the Continuous Operations Facility would likely be selected since it appears to be (and for this example we will assume) 100% compliant.

There is also a possibility that multiple Continuous Operations Facilities could be found at a particular site location (even in the same building) that are using different methods to control access.  Once again, multiple methods of access control from the list of five could be selected for the evaluation, based on the access control methods actually being used for the various 24/7Continuous Operations Facilities.

Once the applicable Continuous Operations Facility access control methods that apply to each of the Continuous Operations Facilities at the site are selected, the site must comply with all of the individual checks for the selected method(s).  Specific checks for requirements associated with a method of access control are found in the Check Content information field.

If there is no Continuous Operations Facility at a particular site this Requirement is Not Applicable (NA) for a review.

&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;Default severity level for this requirement is a Category I (CAT I).

If one or more of the following four checks are the *ONLY* findings (no CAT I checks are found to be deficient), the finding under this requirement may be downgraded to a CAT II severity level.:

2.  If CCTV is used it must send real time images to a continuously manned monitoring station.  

3. Access to a continuously (visually) monitored vault, secure room or collateral classified open storage area must be controlled by an Access Control System (ACS) using coded cards or badges (biometrics or PIN are not required) or by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours. 

If use of an Automated Access Control System (ACS) is used to control access (without use of any authorized visual control methods), use the following six fixes to comply with requirements:

1. The automated ACS must identify individuals and authenticate the person's authority to enter the area through the use of a coded identification (ID) badge or card. 

2. In addition to the swipe or proximity card or badge a personal identification number (PIN) must be used.  This is required WHEN VISUAL (MONITORING) CONTROLS of the entrance ARE NOT USED during working hours.  

3. The PINs must be separately entered into the system by each individual using a keypad device and consist of four or more digits, randomly selected, with no known or logical association with the individuals.  

4. There must be a procedure in place to cover changing PINs when it is believed they have been compromised or subjected to compromise.  

5. Biometrics Devices, which identify an individual requesting access by some unique personal characteristic, such as Fingerprinting, Hand Geometry, Handwriting, Retina scans, or Voice recognition may be used in conjunction with an ID badge or card in lieu of a PIN.  

6.  VERY IMPORTANT: Electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices such as Cipher locks MUST NOT BE USED to control access to secure rooms or areas that are not under continuous visual control during working hours.  Generally these locks do not provide the means for individual access codes and do not report to a central server or system monitor.  Therefore they are permissable ONLY for access control to secure rooms and spaces when the entrance is under continuous visual control.

1.  The FF-L-2740 combination lock securing the primary access door for vaults and secure rooms (AKA: collateral classified open storage areas) may be opened at the beginning of normal duty hours and left unlocked for frequent employee access only if the entrance is properly monitored and controlled.  The combination lock will be secured at the end of normal duty hours and interior motion alarms (if used) activated.  

2.  Entrances to vaults, secure rooms or collateral classified open storage areas must be under visual control at all times during duty hours to prevent entry by unauthorized personnel.

3.  An automated access control system (ACS) may be used to monitor and control admittance during working hours instead of visual control, if it consists of a swipe of proximity coded card and reader, supplemented by the use of a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or by use of Biometric readers (fingerprints, retina scanner, etc.).   

4.  Visual monitoring or control of secure room access points may be accomplished by several methods (e.g., employee work station, guard, "continuously monitored" CCTV).  Employee monitoring may be conducted by cleared employees within the secure room space, who can observe all entrances or employees located just outside the secure room adjacent to an entrance may also "actively" monitor access. If CCTV is used to monitor, the CCTV cameras must cover all potential entrances and send real time images back to a continuously manned monitoring station.

5.  Regardless of the method used (visual methods)to monitor daytime access, a locking system for access control must still be used on the entrance to the secure area. The use of automated access systems, (ie. ACS coded ID cards or badges) is encouraged.  Supplementing the coded (swipe or proximity) cards or badges with a PIN or biometrics is not required if the entrances are properly monitored by visual means.  

6.  Access to secure areas may also be controlled by electric, mechanical or electro-mechanical access control devices to limit access during duty hours, but only if the entrance is under visual control. 

7.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Electrically actuated locks (e.g., cypher, proximity card and magnetic strip card locks) do not afford by themselves the required degree of protection for classified information and must not be used as a substitute for the combination locks meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740. 

CHECKS:

If use of visual control methods is observed as the primary means to control access during duty hours, use the following three checks to evaluate:
 
Check #1.  Check to ensure that all possible primary or secondary entrances to vaults or secure rooms are continuously monitored by cleared employees or guards (inside or outside the room or area) or by CCTV, whenever the FF-L-2740 combination lock is disengaged for daytime or other routine access.

Ensure the following configuration and control considerations are used as appropriate for the type of locks being used in access control systems protecting SIPRNet assets:
1.  Electric Strikes and/or Magnetic Locking devices used in access control systems shall be heavy duty, industrial grade.  2.  Backup batteries and/or emergency power generators should be connected to access control system (ACS) components; however, the total loss of power should be planned for.  3. When used on secure rooms or areas protecting SIPRNet equipment, electric strikes on doors will be set to fail secure in the event of power disruption.  4. On the primary ingress/egress door to secure rooms (which contains the combination lock) the strike may be set to fail open to facilitate access to the room in emergencies only if the door is under continuous visual observation when the combination lock is not secure.  In this instance the combination lock will be immediately secured and subsequently opened as required to allow access to the room. 5. As an alternative the strike on the primary access door (under continuous visual control) may be set to fail secure and configured to allow for opening of the strike lock with a key.  6. Keys for such locks will be strictly controlled, inventoried periodically and not issued to individuals for retention. 7. KEYS TO SECURE ROOMS WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE.  8. When Magnetic Locks (Mag locks) are used on primary access doors the total loss of ALL power (primary and backup) will cause the lock to fail open.  Therefore doors with mag locks installed must be under continuous visual observation when the combination lock is open.  9. Where Mag locks are used on primary access doors and upon a total power failure  - the combination lock will be immediately secured and subsequently opened as required to allow access to the room.  10. Secondary doors not used for access (emergency egress only) should use standard locking door latches rather than electric strikes or mag locks.  11. Access hardware on the side of the door that is external to the room must be removed to prevent use of secondary doors for routine ingress.  12. In the event a mag lock is used on a secondary door, the door must be configured to be locked during a power disruption.  This can be accomplished with internal sliding deadbolt locks or supplemental door latches.  Any secondary door secured with Mag Locks must be under CONTINUOUS  visual observation when the interior deadbolt locks are not engaged.  Deadbolt locks must not be engaged while the room is occupied - for life safety, but will be secured upon closing the secure room or area. 

Always be sure to coordinate door locking and emergency egress considerations with supporting facility risk management (fire/safety) personnel.

Check #11. Access hardware on the side of the secondary door that is external to the room must be removed to prevent use of secondary doors for routine ingress.  

Check #12. In the event a mag lock or electric strike is used on a secondary door, the door must be configured to be locked during a power disruption.  This can be accomplished with internal sliding deadbolt locks or lockable door latches.  Electric strikes on secondary doors should be set to fail secure.  Any secondary door secured with Mag Locks must be under CONTINUOUS  visual observation when the interior deadbolt locks are not engaged.

(CAT II)

Suggested methodology for reviewers:
During the review/walk-around be observant for classified materials (documents media, and equipment) that have been removed from approved storage.  Specifically look to determine if employees are maintaining positive control of the material.  Unless a properly cleared employee is able to clearly see and control the material - this will be a finding.

The employee(s) must be specifically aware the classified material is in their area AND that they are responsible for ensuring it is controlled/protected.  Just having cleared employee(s) “in the area” of the classified material or assuming other cleared employees in the area are responsible for the classified material is not sufficient control.

An example of a possible finding is when someone working on a classified system departs their work space (cube environment) for lunch or other type of break and does not ask another cleared employee to take control of their classified equipment, documents or media OR does not place the classified hard drive, classified documents and classified media in approved storage.

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:  This check is applicable in a tactical environment.

The only exception will be where there is a lack of permanent storage solutions for urgent (short term) tactical operations or other contingency situations.  Primarily this involves field/mobile environments where fixed facilities and equipment are not yet present or incapable of being used.  However, all classified equipment, documents or media not properly stored in a safe, vault or secure room must still be under the continuous observation and control of an appropriately cleared person.

Unless an employee is specifically working on the document - a cover sheet must be placed on it to ensure classified information is not inadvertently exposed.  If the document without a cover sheet is located in a SCIF, Secret or TS vault or secure room - this should not be written as a finding; however, highly recommend use of cover sheets as a best security practice.  If the document w/o cover sheet is found in a Secret Controlled Access Area (CAA) or below, this should be made a finding.    

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed tactical classified processing environments.  It is assumed the type of equipment referenced will be in a fixed environment.  Not applicable to a field/mobile environment.

There are ten individual checks and sub-checks associated with this requirement with five checks defaulting as CAT I.  

The other five checks, which are associated only with classified (SIPRNet) environments with a FN presence default as a CAT II finding.

If just one or all of the five CAT I default checks is found to be deficient then the finding will be a CAT I severity level.

If just one or all of the CAT II default checks is found to be deficient (*and none of the CAT I checks are found to be deficient) then the finding will be listed as a CAT II severity level.

&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;RELATED VULS (STIG ID):

1.  STIG ID: FN-04.01.01.  This requirement concerns two related concerns.  First is control of physical access to areas containing US Only workstations/monitor screens, equipment, media or documents in working environments where Foreign Nationals are employed or present. Second, It also covers maintaining continuous observation and control of US Only classified information system removable storage media and documents within classified storage locations (such as SCIFs, secure rooms or vaults) where foreign nationals are present OR or placement in an approved safe.                         

2. STIG ID: IS-08.01.02.  This requirement concerns maintaining control of Common Access Cards (CACs), SIPRNet tokens AND locking of computer work stations/monitor screens when unattended by removal of CACs, SIPRNet tokens or using Ctrl/Alt/Del.

3. STIG ID: IS-08.03.01.  This requirement is specifically focused on checking written policy/procedures and initial/recurring training concerning cleared employee responsibilities and actions to protect classified work stations (monitor screens) under their control from unauthorized viewing.  This requirement includes environments where US Only monitors or Foreign Nationals are present.

1.  All classified information system processing locations must have physical and procedural controls to ensure that no unauthorized viewing of monitor screens is possible or occurring. This includes viewing by uncleared persons and/or those w/o need-to-know.  It also includes REL partners or other FN who may have been granted liberal physical access to areas where US ONLY classified is processed.  This is the primary purpose for this requirement.

2.  Classified monitor screens must not be visible or capable of being observed from outside the secure space (e.g, from common hallways or through doors or windows).
  
3.  There must be a visitor/escort control procedure in place (that it is actually being used) for announcing unauthorized/uncleared personnel in the area and that uncleared persons and/or those without the need-to-know (to include FN)  are continuously escorted when they are in the immediate vicinity of US classified workstations and components.
 
REQUIREMENTS ONLY FOR CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:

4.  There must be local written procedures AND adequate documented proof of training (annually minimum) covering rules for interaction between US and FN employees.  All US and FN employees must be equally aware of the rules and procedures.  BOTH must be provided with applicable written guidance and training in this area.

5.  U.S.-only workstations must be “grouped” together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers).
 
6.  If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps must be taken:

    a. The U.S. command or agency must authorized an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception.  This exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer level.
  
    b. Develop, publish, and maintain site specific written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations. (in conjunction with written procedures under requirement #4
) 
    c. U.S. personnel must be briefed, trained (annually minimum) and enforce security measures. (in conjunction with training under requirement #4)

NOTE:  Requirement #6 is an allowable alternative to Requirement #5 and one or the other must be conducted.

7.  If a foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel must first ensure:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.

    b.  The organization Foreign Disclosure Officer, Foreign Contact Officer, or Security Manager must be consulted to  ensure the foreign national has a security clearance granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material, and that there is an official need-to-know. 
</fixtext><fix id="F-35923r4_fix" /><check system="C-40629r34_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Traditional.xml" /><check-content>BACKGROUND NOTE:  This requirement includes both situations where there is primarily a US Classified processing environment (no routine Foreign National (FN) presence) AND also contains guidance to be used for environments where FN are employed or present.   It is arranged first by GUIDELINES FOR SITES WITHOUT A FN PRESENCE followed by GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE.
  
Following a lengthy discussion of the guidelines and considerations, the specific checks for this requirement are found, along with the default severity level applicable to each check.

Finally, guidance for applicability to tactical environments is provided.

GUIDELINES FOR SITES WITHOUT A FN PRESENCE:

The following physical controls should be used (individually or collectively) as a guide to evaluate compliance and can be recommended for site use; however, any method or combination of methods clearly being used successfully by the site under review may be acceptable.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
1. The best physical control solution is to locate all US Only classified terminals (open SIPRNet) in areas where only persons with at least a secret (or higher) security clearance have unescorted access. This type of area is commonly known as a secret Controlled Access Area (CAA). Placement of classified terminals in more highly controlled spaces like in secret or top secret (TS) vaults or secure rooms or SCIFs meets the access control requirements of a secret or TS CAA in addition to providing superior physical security of the location.  Such additional physical security protection may be appropriate depending on organization mission and need to continually maintain classified information processing equipment within an open storage environment.
 
2.  Regardless of the type of environment in which classified work stations/monitors are located, ensuring that uncleared persons or those without need-to-know do not have easy access or inadvertent visibility to the classified monitor screens can be accomplished by placing (grouping together) the classified work stations in the back of such rooms/areas or behind partitions.  This ensures uncleared visitors have limited opportunity to walk by a classified monitor and inadvertently be exposed to classified data.

3.  If isolation (grouping in controlled space) of the terminals is not practical, a privacy filter should be placed on each classified (SIPRNET) monitor to prevent ease of observation by any unauthorized individual simply passing by.  This is a good idea even if other physical controls of classified work stations are used.  The use of the privacy filters is an excellent alternative solution where physical separation or repositioning of monitors in rooms is not possible due to space limitations.

4. Classified monitor screens should not be placed facing doorways or windows through which public or unrestricted viewing of the monitor is possible. If space limitations do not allow for such placement then ensuring doors are closed or that windows are covered by screens or blinds during classified processing can be used - but only if this procedure is part of documented security procedures and security training.
  
5. Finally a solution for areas where work stations (cubes) are used is to place doors or the less costly cube screens across the openings for use when classified work is being conducted.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
While the “possible solutions” cover a range of suggest compliance possibilities the following covers an absolute requirement for which there can be no exception:

1.  When uncleared visitors need to enter CAAs,  secure rooms, vaults or SCIFs where classified work stations are located there must be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering.  This will allow time for screens and classified material to be covered from view.
  
2.  All uncleared visitors must be under continuous escort by a properly cleared employee while within the CAA/secure room/vault/or SCIF. 

GUIDELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:
  
Environments where FN are present (may even be embedded as US DoD employees) require even more diligence and additional considerations for protection of US Only classified (SIPRNet) terminal s screens/workstation screens/ and monitors.  This is because while sharing of certain specific classified information may be permitted,  there is always the possibility that US Only or NOFORN information may also be present within the physical environment or accessible on visible/unprotected workstation screens.

Foreign Nationals, even if they are embedded partners in US DoD operations, are not afforded access to any and all US classified information.  This erroneous assumption is prevalent in many CC/S/A operation centers where FN liaison and exchange personnel are routinely present.  Release of US classified information can only be made to FN partners if specifically compliant with National Disclosure Policy, has been determined releasable to the Foreign National’s host country and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material.

*Where FN are present (regardless of their authorized physical and systems access or security clearance) - US Only work stations and network equipment must be under strict US control at all times.
  
This process involves a combination of physical control measures AND employee awareness. Reviewers must use a flexible approach with an understanding of the synergistic relationship of physical controls and employee awareness to properly evaluate compliance.

REGULATORY STANDARD FOR ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:   This relationship of physical protective measures with employee awareness gained through procedures and training is based on the following excerpt from CJCSI 6510-01F: 
In areas where there is the potential for Foreign National Access to U.S.-Only Workstations and Network Equipment, CC/S/As shall:

1.  Maintain strict U.S. control of U.S.-only workstations and network equipment at all times.  This includes network equipment such as printers, copiers, and faxes.

2.  Group U.S.-only workstations together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers).

3.  If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps shall be taken:

    a. The U.S. command or agency shall authorize an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception. NOTE: this exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer.

    b. Develop, publish, and maintain specific site written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations.

    c. Ensure that U.S. personnel are briefed and enforce security measures.
    
4.  Announce presence. If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times.  In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.

5.  If the foreign national is permitted to view the screen, U.S. personnel must ensure:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and shall be consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.

    b.  Check with organization security office to ensure foreign national has security clearances granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved and an official need-to-know.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
The following physical controls should be used (individually or collectively) as a guide to evaluate compliance and can be recommended for site use; however, any method or combination of methods clearly being used successfully by the site under review may be acceptable:

1.  The "best physical control solution" is to locate all US Only terminals in areas where the FN do not have easy access or visibility to the monitor screens.  This can be accomplished by placing them in the back of rooms/areas or behind partitions.  Normally if US Only SIPRNet PCs are placed in the back of a room or within the secure space the REL/FN  work stations would then be placed near the front of the area to reduce the frequency of FN officers passing by US Only SIPRNet (or other US Only classified) work stations.  When FN employees need to enter areas where US Only work stations are located there should be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering.  This will allow time for screens and classified material not releasable to FN to be covered from view.

2.  If isolation of the terminals is not practical, a privacy filter should be placed on each US Only classified (SIPRNET) monitor to prevent ease of observation by any unauthorized individual.  This is a good idea even if physical separation of US Only and REL/FN work stations is used.  The use of the privacy filters is the best alternative “physical control solution” where physical separation in rooms is not possible due to space limitations and/or the impeding of interaction between US personnel and FN partners.
 
3.  Another acceptable physical security alternative solution for areas where work stations (cubes) are used is to place doors or the less costly cube screens across the openings for when classified work (especially on the US Only cubes) is being performed.
                                                   
4. Finally, in addition to any physical separation, obscuration or other control measures in place (or lack thereof) written local policy/procedures and initial/recurring training are absolutely necessary to ensure that all US personnel are:

    a.  Aware of REL/FN Officers presence in common work areas when working on non-releasable applications/sites on the SIPRNet and

    b.  Aware of exactly what classified or sensitive information is not releasable.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
While the “possible solutions” cover a range of suggest compliance possibilities the following covers an absolute requirement for which there can be no exception:

1.  When uncleared visitors need to enter CAAs , secure rooms, vaults or SCIFs where classified work stations are located there must be a procedure to ensure their presence is announced before entering.  This will allow time for screens and classified material to be covered from view.
  
2.  All uncleared visitors must be under continuous escort by a properly cleared employee while within the CAA/secure room/vault/or SCIF.
 
3.  Announce presence of Foreign Nationals (FN).   If a foreign national is permitted access to U.S.-controlled workstation space, the individual must be announced, must wear a badge clearly identifying him or her as a foreign national, and must be escorted at all times.  In addition, a warning light must be activated if available and screens must be covered or blanked.

4. If the foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel must ensure:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01.

    b. A check with the organization security office is conducted to ensure the foreign national has security clearances granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, that an appropriate DDL is on-hand to validate the security clearance and release of US classified information, and that there is an official need-to-know.

CHECKS FOR *BOTH* US ONLY CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT FN PRESENCE AND ENVIRONMENTS WITH FN PRESENCE:

1.  CHECK all classified monitor locations to ensure that no unauthorized viewing is possible or occurring. This includes viewing by uncleared persons and/or those w/o need-to-know.  It also includes REL partners or other FN who may have been granted liberal physical access to areas where US ONLY classified is processed.  This check is the primary action for reviewers under this requirement. (CAT I)

2.  CHECK/validate that classified monitors cannot be observed from outside the secure space (e.g, from common hallways or through doors or windows).  (CAT I)

3.  CHECK access control procedures and observe actual escort procedures.  Ensure there is a process (and that it is actually being used) for announcing unauthorized/uncleared personnel in the area and that uncleared persons and/or those without the need-to-know (to include FN)  are continuously escorted when they are in the immediate vicinity of US classified workstations and components. (CAT I)

CHECKS *ONLY FOR* CLASSIFIED (SIPRNet) ENVIRONMENTS WITH *FN PRESENCE*:

4.  CHECK to ensure there are local written procedures AND adequate documented proof of training (annually minimum) covering rules for interaction between US and FN employees.  All US and FN employees must be equally aware of the rules and procedures.  BOTH must be provided with applicable written guidance and training in this area. (CAT II)

5.  CHECK that U.S.-only workstations are “grouped” together in a U.S.-controlled workstation space when workstations are located in workspaces physically accessible by foreign nationals (such as combined operations centers). (CAT II)

6.  CHECK that If the grouping of U.S.-only workstations at a site is not operationally possible, the following steps have been taken:

    a. The U.S. command or agency has authorized an exception at the site, in writing, stating operational reasons for exception, and maintain the record of exception.  This exception must be approved by the appropriate CC/S/A level of command, which is normally a 3 or 4 star Flag Officer level.  (CAT II)

    b. Develop, publish, and maintain site specific written procedures on security measures to safeguard U.S.-only classified workstations. (in conjunction with written procedures required for CHECK #4) (CAT II)

    c. Ensure that U.S. personnel are briefed, trained (annually minimum) and enforce security measures.  (in conjunction with training required for CHECK #4)

NOTE:  CHECK #6 is an allowable alternative to CHECK #5 and one or the other must be conducted.

7.  CHECK that if a foreign national is permitted to view a US Only screen, U.S. personnel have ensured:

    a.  Information is releasable in accordance with CC/S/A guidance and is consistent with National Disclosure Policy (NDP)-1; DoDD 5230.11; DoDD 5230.20; DoD Manual 5200.01; and CJCSI 5221.01. (CAT I)

    b.  The organization Foreign Disclosure Officer, Foreign Contact Officer, or Security Manager was consulted to  ensure the foreign national has a security clearance granted by his or her government at a level equal to that of the classified information involved, and a Delegation of Disclosure Letter (DDL) has been issued to the specific FN partner to support the release of US classified information or material, and that there is an official need-to-know. (CAT I)

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT:
 
1. This check is applicable for all classified processing environments including a field/mobile environment. Commanders in such environments may use whatever means available or feasible to control unauthorized physical access to classified monitors.
  
2.  This check is applicable where REL Partners or other FN allies are employed within fixed facilities located in a theater of operations (tactical environment) with physical access to US Classified or Sensitive Systems.

3.  Wherever classified systems/with screens/monitors are used, uncleared persons must always be escorted when permitted in the physical processing environment.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The DoD Common Access Cards (CAC) a "smart" card, is the standard identification for active-duty military personnel, Selected Reserve, DoD civilian employees, and eligible contractor personnel.  It is also the principal card used to enable physical access to buildings and controlled spaces, and it provides access to defense computer networks and systems. 
 
The card, which is the property of the U.S. Government, is required to be in the personal custody of the member at all times.

System Access Tokens are also used on the SIPRNet and the cards along with a Personal identity Number (PIN) can be used to access classified information on the SIPRNet in lieu of a logon ID and password.

CAC and SIPRNet tokens are very important components for providing both physical and logical access control to DISN assets and must therefore be strictly controlled.

Physically co-locating REL Partners or other FN - who have limited access to the SIPRNet or other US Classified systems - near US personnel in a collateral classified (Secret or higher) open storage area or in a Secret or higher Controlled Access Area (CAA) that processes classified material is permissible for operational efficiency and coordination.
  
Failure to limit access to information systems is especially important in mixed US/FN environments.   This is particularly important on US Only classified terminals when not personally and physically attended by US personnel.  The failure to properly disable information workstations and monitor screens when unattended can result in FN personnel having unauthorized access to classified information, which can result in the loss or compromise of classified information, including NOFORN information. 

Appropriate but simple physical and procedural security measures must be put in place to ensure that unauthorized persons to include FN partners do not have unauthorized access to information not approved for release to them.  Control of CACs, SIPRNet tokens and locking of computer work stations when unattended is an important aspect of proper procedural security measure implementation.
&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;The default severity level is Category I (CAT I) based on the following requirement to lock server, work station and monitor screens connected to the DISN (SIPRNet and NIPRNet)  when not physically attended:

Hard Drives/Monitors/Keyboards are not disabled (locked) by CAC or Token Removal, or Lock Computer via Ctrl/Alt/Del, when not personally and physically attended by cleared US personnel. (CAT I)

If the above deficiency is not discovered (monitor screens are properly locked when unattended) but a CAC or SIPRNet Token is discovered not under the personal control of the person to whom it was issued then the finding may be reduced to CAT II.  Following is the applicable finding relative to a CAT II severity level:

CACs and other tokens are left unattended and are not in the physical custody of the person to whom they were issued. (CAT II)

SF 701, “Activity Security Checklist,” must be used to record these checks. 

In addition to the SF 701, the responsible site or organization should have a written procedure to outline the end-of-day check process and to guide checkers with their duties. For instance the procedure should include instructions on how to handle any classified information that is found outside of proper storage.

An integral part of the security check system must incorporate the securing of all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for storing classified material. SF 702, “Security Container Check Sheet,” must be used to record each opening, closing, and verification checks of these storage mediums.  

Area verification checks will be recorded on the SF 701 upon completion of end-of-day checks.  Following are recommended end-of-day checks, which should be included on the SF 701, but ultimately the checks must be tailored to fit the physical configuration and mission of the site:                                                      
a. Activation of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alarm sensors where applicable.

c.  Removal of CAC Cards from workstations.
d.  All windows, doors or other openings are properly secured.                                          
e.  Verification of lock box closure for SIPRNet wall jacks and PDS lines, where applicable.
f.  Additional checks such as turning off of coffee pots and lights, power-off of printers/MFDs, securing of STE keys, etc. can be identified and accomplished as part of the check.

Results of end-of-day checks (SF 701 forms) should be retained for at least 30 days (or otherwise as required by Component records management schedules) after completion of the monthly form to ensure availability for audits and resolution of subsequent discovery of security incidents or discrepancies.  While 24/7 operational areas storing classified materials do not necessarily require end-of-day (EOD) checks it is highly recommended that a system of checks be instituted (similar to EOD checks) upon each change of shift.  Such checks jointly conducted by incoming and outgoing supervisors can be used to verify the integrity of safes and classified equipment/materials under their control and can be used to narrow the window of time for a preliminary inquiry should a security incident occur.</fixtext><fix id="F-35926r4_fix" /><check system="C-40634r3_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Traditional.xml" /><check-content>Organizations that process or store classified information must establish a system of security checks at the close of each duty and/or business day to ensure that any area where classified information is used or stored is secure.

This STIG Check concerns ONLY PROCEDURES for the reproduction (copying) of classified DOCUMENTS on Multi-Functional Devices (MFD) connected to the DISN.

General guidance: Paper copies, electronic files, and other material containing classified information shall be reproduced only when necessary for accomplishing the organization’s mission or for complying with applicable statutes or Directives.  Personnel reproducing classified information are knowledgeable of the procedures for classified reproduction and aware of the risks involved with the specific reproduction equipment being used and the appropriate countermeasures they are required to take.   Reproduced material is to be placed under the same accountability and control requirements as applied to the original material.     

Classified material is to be reproduced only on approved and, when applicable, properly accredited systems. 

Ensure: 
 
1. Procedures for the proper reproduction of classified documents are posted on or near the MFD copiers approved for classified reproduction.  The procedures must alert users the particular copier is approved for classified reproduction. 
 
2. Other copiers in the organization that are not approved for classified document reproduction must also be marked to alert users of the prohibition against making classified copies. 
  
3.  Unless the MFD copier can be properly purged of all classified data or images after each use for classified - it must be housed in an area approved for open storage of classified material.  Be aware that many current copiers and multi-functional devices (MFD) contain hard drives that collect and store images and data.  Such machines must always be maintained in space approved for open storage of classified.
  
4. ONLY copiers that can be properly purged of classified data or images after each period of copying classified may be maintained outside space approved for classified open storage  - but this must be in space where access is controlled to at least the level of the classified material authorized to be copied on the machine.  This would be a Secret Controlled Access Area (CAA)for MFD connected to SIPRNet.  

5. Procedures posted near the copier must contain steps for users to take after copying classified documents.  Steps must include double checking of the copier for missed pages, counting original and copied pages, purging of images (if applicable), use of cover sheets, and general protection/control guidelines for reproduced documents.

Fixes:

1. Only crosscut shredders listed on an EPL for High Security Crosscut Paper Shredders can be used to destroy classified material. 

2. Only pulverizers, disintegrators and pulping (wet process) devices listed on an EPL can be used to destroy classified water-soluble material.  

3. Burn bags (if used to store classified paper awaiting destruction at a central destruction facility) must be sealed and safeguard in a safe or vault or area approved for classified open storage until actually destroyed.

Checks:   

Check #1. Check that only crosscut shredders listed on an EPL for High Security Crosscut Paper Shredders are used to destroy classified material. 

Check #2. Check that only pulverizers, disintegrators and pulping (wet process) devices listed on an EPL are used to destroy classified water-soluble material.  

Check #3.  Check to ensure that burn bags (if used to store classified paper awaiting destruction at a central destruction facility) are sealed and safeguard in a safe or vault or area approved for classified open storage until actually destroyed.  

NOTE:  Recommend that reviewers check shredded material, no matter how new or old the shredder appears to be.  Look to determine if it is readily apparent the shred material is “not within specifications” due to lack of maintenance, bad teeth, etc., This discovery can result in a finding.

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: Applies in all environments whenever classified documents are to be destroyed.

Refresher training shall also address the threat and the techniques foreign intelligence activities use while attempting to obtain controlled unclassified DoD information and advise personnel of penalties for unauthorized disclosures. The importance of unclassified information, its potential sensitivity, and the requirement to have all information reviewed and approved for release prior to public disclosure or Web posting shall be reiterated. Refresher training shall also address relevant changes in CUI policy or procedures and issues or concerns identified during DoD Component oversight reviews.                                


Checks:

Check #1. Reviewers must check for an initial orientation on handling of CUI during new employee inprocessing 

Check #2. Check that Annual Refresher training includes the topic of CUI as provided in the general policy guidance.  Check a sample number of individual training records and Annual Training briefing slides/materials for evidence of CUI training.   

Lack of either intitial orientation or refresher training or both is a finding.                                    

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed (established) tactical processing environments where training and associated documentation should be in place.  Not applicable to a field/mobile environment.

1. Unclassified Hard Drives:  

a.  When no longer needed, unclassified computer systems and hard drives may be disposed of outside the Department of Defense. In some circumstances, the equipment may be provided to non-government entities for reutilization. To ensure that no data or information remains on operable unclassified hard drives that are transferred or permanently removed from DoD custody, the drives must be sanitized by overwriting. 

b.  Where overwriting is inappropriate or cannot be completely accomplished (e.g., inoperable disk) the drives are to be totally removed from service (i.e., thrown away).  In this case the drives must be physically destroyed before disposal.  

c.  The specific methods and procedures differ depending on sensitivity of data and ownership of the hard drive. To ensure DoD information is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals, the activity security manager should coordinate with the local DAA and/or IT staff to ensure local procedures for disposal of computer hard drives appropriately address removal of U.S. Government data prior to disposal. (See Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence Memorandum, Disposition of Unclassified DoD Computer Hard Drives, June 4, 2001 for detailed guidance.) Generally the use of Hard Drive degaussers with an appropriate strength (Coercivity of magnetic field) for the drive being erased (Oestrid rating) is recommended as part of the requirement for physical destruction. After degaussing the hard drive the physical destruction of individual platters should be accomplished to make attempted data retrieval impractical.

2.  Unclassified Automated Information System (AIS) Media:

a. Various types of AIS media may contain CUI and must be disposed of in accordance with guidance in the NIST Special Publication 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization.   

b. NSA/CSS publishes lists of products that meet specific performance criteria for sanitizing, destroying or disposing of various types of media containing sensitive or classified information.  The lists are available at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/guidance/media_destruction_guidance/index.shtml or by calling (410)854-6358. 

3.  Unclassified documents:

a. Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of in accordance with the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 33 and Component records management directives. 

b. Non-record FOUO documents may be destroyed by shredding or tearing into pieces and discarding the pieces in regular trash containers.  

c. NOTE: The guidance provided here is for FOUO paper documents and this is the least stringent standard found for any CUI document destruction.  There are other types of  CUI, such as DEA Sensitive material, which must be destroyed by a means approved for destruction of Confidential material. Be certain to check DoD Manual 5200.01 for specific destruction requirements for each type of CUI document.  

4. Additional considerations:

a. Periodically inspect recycle bins, regular trash, and the availability of shredders or collection containers for sensitive material.   Ensure it is known who gets the recycling (especially if it contains CUI) and that it is disposed of properly.  NOTE:  If you find (ie. in the trash) and can easily reconstruct any document marked FOUO (or other CUI document) and it contains extremely sensitive information such as PII (with SSN, etc)  - this should be investigated and corrective actions taken immediately.  

b. While not required it is highly recommended using at least a cross cut shredder for destruction of CUI documents.  Further, while a shred-all policy is also not required, this is another strong recommendation.

Standards of protection for most types of CUI are the same as for FOUO but some variance does exist.  Therefore, specific requirements for certain CUI may need to be checked against applicable references to ensure proper protection is afforded.  The fixes are applicable to all forms of CUI: documents, AIS hard drives and storage media.  


Fixes applicable for FOUO:

For most CUI and FOUO specifically ensure the following standards are met: 

1.  During working hours, reasonable steps shall be taken to minimize the risk of access by unauthorized personnel.  This would include things like placing cover sheets on FOUO documents and allowing unescorted access to areas where CUI (documents and AIS storage media) is processed/handled to only those persons with at least a favorably adjudicated National Agency CHeck (NAC). 

2.  After working hours, FOUO information (documents and AIS storage media) may be stored in unlocked containers, desks, or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building security is provided. If such building security is not provided or is deemed inadequate, the information (documents and AIS storage media) shall be stored in locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases, locked rooms, etc.  In all cases FOUO and other CUI must be placed out of sight during non-working hours. While not required, implementation of a clean desk policy would be a good idea.  

3.  Unescorted access to computer rooms or areas containing major items of AIS equipment processing CUI information (servers and network components) should only be granted to persons with at least a favorable NAC.  All others should be physically escorted. Access control measures such as reception personnel, guards, keyed locks, cipher locks or automted access control systems may be used to control access to such areas.

Check #2.  After working hours, FOUO information (documents and removable media) may be stored in unlocked containers, desks, or cabinets if Government or Government-contract building security is provided. If such building security is not provided or is deemed inadequate, the information (documents and removable media) shall be stored in locked desks, file cabinets, bookcases, locked rooms, etc.  In all cases FOUO and other CUI documents must be placed out of sight during non-working hours.

All positions (military and civilian) must be categorized as either nonsensitive, noncritical-sensitive, or critical-sensitive based on security clearance and/or ADP (AKA: IT) position requirements.  

The type of background investigation (eg, SSBI, NACI) applicable to the position is based upon the designated position sensitivity.  

While Contractor personnel are not assigned to positions within DoD organizations, the type of investigation and security clearance requirements for each type or category of work must be detailed in the applicable Statement of Work and/or DD Form 254 (Contract Security Specification).  

Users of DoD Information Systems (IS) are either privileged users (e.g., system administrators) or general users (e.g., non-IS associated system users). 

Fixes:

Fix #1. Review organizational manning records that indicate the position sensitivity of all employees and review all positions for the correct Information Technology (IT) sensitivity level (AKA: Automated Data Processing (ADP) sensitivity level) and security clearance requirement.  *Ensure that the position sensitivity level is correct based on the clearance and IT level. 
                                              
Fix #2. For general users (non-privileged access) of information systems: Ensure they meet the minimum standards, criteria, and guidelines for access to controlled unclassified and classified information, as follows:

a.  Prior to being granted access to the NIPRNET, U.S. military, government civilian, and contractor personnel must minimally have a favorably completed NAC and a Common Access Card (CAC) with PKI Certificates issued.  For government civilians a NAC plus Written Inquiries (NACI) must have been requested.

b.  At a minimum prior to being granted access to the SIPRNET, U.S. military, government civilian, and contractor personnel must have a favorably completed NAC and have been granted an interim SECRET clearance.

c. Foreign nationals must meet standards, criteria, and guidelines for access to controlled unclassified and classified information IAW DoD Manual 5200.01, DoD 5200.2-R, CJCSI 6510.01F and National Disclosure Policy.   

Fix #3. For privileged users (eg, SA, IAO, NSO): Ensure that privileged users if military or government civilian are in critical sensitive positions and have a successfully adjudicated SSBI with 5-year periodic reviews.  Contractors performing work in priviledged IS roles must also undergo sucessful SSBIs with 5-year reviews.  Privileged users must undergo an SSBI regardless of of the security clearance level required (eg, even if no clearance or only Confidential or Secret is required).

When checking how an organization validates security clearance information for systems access the first thing to consider is there are various categories of personnel and associated considerations with each one.  These categories include:  Military employees, Government Civilian employees, Contract employees, Foreign Nationals and Local National employees under a Status of Forces (SOFA) agreement and Visitors. 

Ask what procedures are used for verifying that all personnel that have access to classified information systems have the appropriate security clearance and access authorization. 

Generally, organizations validation of clearance levels should come from JPAS, DCII, a service or agency data base or higher security office.  Also note that organization manning documents should include the required clearance level for each Military and Civilian position and should be requested for review.

Fixes:

1. Review all the organization personnel security records and compare with applicable System Access Authorization Request forms to ensure proper validation of clearance levels. Be especially aware of ALL those who have "privileged" systems access (such as SAs, IAOs, Network Admin, etc.) and ensure that correct clearance and IT assurance level have been granted.

2.  If there are contract employees with systems access ensure there is a Statement of Work with accompanying DD 254 (Contract Security Specification) that covers security clearance requirements for each type of work being performed by contractors.  

3.  Ensure that a delegation of disclosure authority letter (DDL) is on-hand in all cases where US Classified information is released/shared with Foreign National Exchange or Liaison personnel.  

4. Ensure that a Limited Access Authorization (LAA) is on hand when system access to classified information is granted to an immigrant alien or a foreign national - not associated with or representing a foreign government.

Ensure that organization manning documents (eg., JTD) and position descriptions for Military and Government Civilians and the statement of work and/or DD 254 (Contract Security Specification) for Contractors – are available for identification of current ADP (AKA:  IT position) designations.
  
Ensure that IT position (AKA: ADP) designations are assigned to each civilian and military position or contractor employee duties contained in statements of work in which an employee has duties requiring access to a Government Information System (IS).  * In most cases this will encompass 100% of all employees.

NOTE 1: Personnel Occupying Information Systems Positions Designated ADP-I, ADP-II and ADP-III. DoD military, civilian personnel, consultants, and contractor personnel performing on unclassified automated information systems may be assigned to one of three position sensitivity designations (in accordance with Appendix 10 of DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program) and MINIMALLY investigated as follows:

Regardless of the location the key factor in determining acceptable compliance is if the equipment is accessible only to properly vetted persons who require unescorted access to the equipment for performance of duties.  
   
NOTE 3: While not preferred, if space and/or size of the Information Systems (IS) assets do not allow for being housed in a  separate room or closet they may be maintained in locked Information System (IS) cabinets that preclude ease of access by unauthorized individuals.   

2. Check to ensure that properly managed access control systems, mechanical access devices, or keyed locks are being used to control access to these rooms, closets or cabinets.  

NOTE 4: If keyed locks are used check to ensure that proper key control procedures are in place.  

TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The check is applicable for fixed (established) tactical processing environments.  Not applicable to a field/mobile environment.

The first two fixes are specifically for Unclassified DISN facilities, while fixes 3, 4, 5 and 6 are for facilites containing SIPRNet asstes.  Where both NIPRNet and SIPRNet assets are contained in a facility - the more strigent standards for SIPRNet will be used.

Checks:

1. Ensure that any facility/building housing Unclassified Information System assets conected to the DISN (such as end user NIPRNet work stations) has at least one physical barrier supplemented by any type of 24/7 access control (keyed locks, reception, guards, Access Control System, Cipher Locks, etc.).

2. Ensure that Unclassified Computer Rooms containing equipment connected to the DISN (located within a facility or bldg meeting the standard in #1 above) have an additional layer of physical protection and access control. This fix is intended for rooms with key system assets such as servers, routers, etc., rather than end user workstations.  

3. Ensure that every physical access point to facilities housing DISN workstations that process or display classified information is guarded or alarmed 24/7 (minimum of alarm contacts on the doors) and that intrusion alarms are properly monitored.  

4. Ensure two forms of identification are required to gain access to a facility housing DISN workstations that process or display classified information (e.g., key card with PIN/biometrics or two forms of picture ID present to a guard or receptionist). 

NOTE 1: Physical access points to facilities housing DISN workstations that process or display classified information, which are located on an access controlled military installation (or that employ another layer of physical barrier/access control) are not required to have an IDS alarm contact on the doors and need only one level of access control.  For instance access control to the facility using only a swipe or prox card (w/o PIN or biometrics) or a guard checking a single picture ID is acceptable. 

5. Ensure that a visitor log is maintained for facilities or buildings containing DISN workstations that process or display classified information. Access Control System (ACS) log entries may be used to meet this requirement. 

6. Where there are Information System assets stored in secure rooms (AKA: collateral classified open storage areas) that are connected to the SIPRNet - ensure that the senior agency official has determined in writing that security-in-depth exists. 

NOTE 2: Fixess number 3, 4, 5 and 6 are intended to only assess the appropriateness of physical barriers and access control measures leading to or surrounding Secure Rooms, rather than actual secure room protection measures.  Classified Computer Rooms must have additional layers of physical protection and access control, which are implemented IAW Secure Room standards.  Again, Secure Room standards are not covered under this fix for security-in-depth.  They are covered elsewhere on the checklist.  To reiterate in another way; these fixes are strictly for areas containing classified DISN assets that ARE NOT maintained in spaces approved for collateral classified open storage (such as secure rooms, vaults or SCIFs).  Typically the type of applicable area covered by this fix will be an area designated as a Secret (or possibly Top Secret) Controlled Access Area (CAA).

Not conducting any checks of the PDS alarm functionality will also result in a CAT I finding.  Alarms not continuously monitored by  properly cleared US Personnel at a 24/7 monitoring location will also result in a CAT I finding.

May be reduced to CAT II if the PDS alarm system functions properly and checks of the alarm system are conducted at a frequency less than on a weekly basis.  Checks must be conduct at least every 3-months or a CAT I severity level must be applied. 

May be reduced to a CAT II if the PDS alarm functions properly and checks of the alarm system are conducted on a weekly basis but the alarm system sensor employed is not approved by the cognizant COMSEC and/or physical security authorities and/or documentation does not exist to support this approval. 

May be reduced to a CAT III if the PDS alarm functions properly and checks of the alarm system are conducted on at least a weekly basis but there is no SOP detailing actions for checking the system functionality or response to alarms.&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;There are three types of PDS classified as Hardened Distribution Systems:  1.

The other two types are Hardened Carrier or Continuously Viewed Carrier. 

Ensure unencrypted SIPRNet data cables are installed in a carrier properly configured as an "Alarmed Carrier" IAW the following guidelines: 

1. Ideally the carrier will be constructed of solid electrical metallic tubing (EMT), ferrous conduit or pipe, or rigid-sheet steel ducting, utilizing elbows, couplings, nipples, and connectors of the same material. Connectors need not be permanently sealed in an alarmed carrier.  As a minimum the carrier may consist of of any material equal to or better than standards for a "Simple PDS" (e.g., wood, PVT, EMT, ferrous conduit.  The key to determining the appropriateness of a PDS carrier is its suitability for supporting the functionality of the approved alarm sensor, which provides a means to detect tampering and/or breach of the actual PDS carrier - *not a breach of the space surrounding the carrier. An IDS sensor capable of detecting changes in carrier air pressure is an example of an acceptable detection methodology. 

2. The alarm system sensor employed must be approved by the cognizant COMSEC and/or physical security authorities.  Documentation must exist to support this approval. 

3. The alarm system and signal transmission must be in an IDS meeting the requirements of the Appendix to Enclosure 3 of DoD Manual 5200.01. 

4. The alarm signal must be sent to a 24/7 monitor station that is supervised continuously by U.S. citizens who have been subjected to a trustworthiness determination according to DoD 5200.2-R.  

5. PDS alarm functionality and performance must be verified on at leasts a weekly basis IAW Table B-4 of the NSTISSI 7003. 

6. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) must be available, which is approved by the facility security officer or security manager and commander/director, and the PDS approval authority. This SOP must include procedures to:

a. Verify the alarm functionality and performance on at leasts a weekly basis IAW Table B-4 of the NSTISSI 7003. 

b. Ensure response by security personnel in the area of possible attempted penetration, within 15 minutes of discovery; 
 
c. Provide for inspection of the PDS to determine the cause of the alarm;

d. Define action to be taken regarding the termination of transmission;

e. Initiate investigation of actual intrusion attempt, etc.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  A properly installed and functional alarmed PDS that is successfully tested at least weekly need not be installed so that it is completely visible.    </fixtext><fix id="F-37378r2_fix" /><check system="C-41605r19_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="VMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_Traditional.xml" /><check-content>An Alarmed PDS is one of three types of Hardened Distribution Systems allowed IAW the NSTISSI 7003.
