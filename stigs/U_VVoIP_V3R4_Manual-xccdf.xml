For DoD, this presents two issues or vulnerabilities. Access to voicemail from a telephone only requires the user’s telephone number and a PIN. The telephone number is the account or mailbox number on the voicemail system while the PIN is the user password for accessing the account. This is a rather weak authentication method. The first issue for DoD, is that DoD policy states that access to email requires CAC/PKI based authentication of the user before they are granted access to their email account. Additionally, CAC based PKI certificates are required to decrypt encrypted email. CAC based authentication is not available when using a standard telephone. While some organizations might implement CAC authenticated access to the site’s phone system, such a facility is not available via most DoD phone systems and certainly not via the PSTN. Additionally, while a non-CAC enabled text-to-speech feature would not be able to read encrypted email (which would be considered the most sensitive) the unencrypted email is still considered sensitive DoD information. The argument could be made that normal voicemail messages and regular telephone conversations can also contain sensitive information, however, there is typically more sensitive information in email. Due to these two issues email should not be accessible via the voicemail / unified messaging / mail text-to-speech feature in DoD. That said, this issue does not apply to DoD issued PDA/PED devices that provide CAC authenticated access to email. An example of such a device is the CAC enabled Blackberry. In this case, access to unified mail voicemail would be via the CAC authenticated email service through which the user could listen to the voicemail. Text-to-speech conversion would be permitted in this case even though caution should be used when listening to any voicemail, particularly in a public place. The use of a wired earphone is highly recommended. Wireless Bluetooth earphones or headsets are vulnerable. Guidance for their use can be found in the Wireless STIG. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain. &lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Voice Mail</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Voice Mail</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1773</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20189r1_fix">In the event an email text-to-speech feature is employed or enabled in a unified messaging system, and accessed via the dial-in voicemail access method, ensure CAC based authentication is used to access the feature as is required for normal email access control.

Disable the text-to-speech feature of a unified mail service.

In the event an email text-to-speech feature is employed or enabled in a unified messaging / mail system, and accessed via the dial-in voicemail access method, ensure DoD PKI/CAC based authentication is used to access the feature as is required for normal email access control. Otherwise, disable the text-to-speech feature as well as any other dial-up method that does not provide for CAC authentication for accessing email. 

Determine if the site has implemented a unified mail system where voicemail is delivered via the user’s email mailbox. This will normally imply that email could be available via normal voicemail access from a standard telephone and that the email is read to the user via a text-to-speech conversion feature. 

This is a finding in the event email is accessible via voicemail unless this access method employs CAC/PKI.

NOTE: Access to the email service must already be in compliance with DoD email access policy using CAC/PKI. Therefore, this requirement does not apply to accessing and listening to voicemail via the email service.

NOTE: This requirement does not apply to the text-to-speech feature in a unified messaging system that is implemented on a classified network such as the SIPRNet where CAC/PKI user authentication has not been established. When CAC/PKI authentication is implemented in the future on such networks, this caveat will not apply.

Alternately have the IAO or SA demonstrate compliance with the requirement.

NOTE: In some unified messaging / mail systems the email server is typically a separate server from the voicemail server. These may not be collocated with each other and may not even be from the same vendor. It is commonplace to have a voicemail vendor’s server interoperate with Microsoft Exchange servers.  As such, there is typically an add-on application installed to the email server (exchange or otherwise) which is where the text-to-speech application would typically reside. This might make it difficult to inspect the configuration of the server where the application resides.

That is, auto-registration is not disabled if available</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Traditional telephone systems require physical wiring and/or switch configuration changes to add an instrument to the system. This makes it difficult for someone to add an unauthorized digital instrument to the system. This, however, could be done easier with older analog systems by tapping an existing analog line. With VoIP, this is no longer the case. Some VoIP systems employ an automatic means of detecting and registering a new instrument on the network with the local session controller (LSC) and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. This feature is called ‘auto-registration’ and can be used to initially connect and test un-configured instruments. This presents a vulnerability whereby unauthorized instruments could be added to the system, or instruments could be moved without authorization. Such activity can happen anywhere there is an active network port or outlet. This is not only a configuration management problem but it could also allow theft of services or some other malicious attack. It is recognized however, that auto-registration is necessary during large deployments of VoIP  instruments, as well as a short time thereafter, to facilitate additions and troubleshooting. This applies to initial system setup and to any subsequent large redeployments or additions. Normal, day to day, moves, additions, and changes will require manual registration. Since, it may be possible for an unauthorized VoIP   instrument to easily be added to the system during auto-registration, the registration logs must be compared to the authorized terminal inventory. Alternately the system could have a method of automatically registering only pre-authorized terminals. This feature would support VoIP instruments that are DAA approved for connection from multiple local or remote locations. The Auto-registration feature provided in some VoIP systems creates various issues. In general, this feature allows any end instrument to function using a default configuration, as soon as it is plugged into the network without prior authorization and configuration by an SA. In general, this feature should never be used even in the limited situations mentioned in the requirement, since the SA loses control of the system.

If this was to occur, there could be inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals without the proper clearance or need-to-know. This vulnerability could occur if the endpoint was set to automatically answer a voice, VTC, or collaboration call with audio and video capabilities enabled, or if the endpoint was compromised and remotely controlled. The stated requirements and mitigations involve muting the microphone(s) and disabling or covering the camera(s). These or similar vulnerabilities could exist in PC based communications/collaboration applications due to an auto answer feature or compromised application or platform. As such, the simplest mitigation would be to only operate the software that accesses the microphone and camera when they are needed for communication. This does not work well for a unified communications application that is used to enhance our communications/collaboration capabilities since the application would be running most, if not all of the time when the PC is operating. In this case, the microphone could be muted and camera disabled in software as a mitigation. However, this also may not work well due to the possibility of the communications/collaboration application, microphone, or camera could be remotely activated if the platform or a communications application is compromised. In this case positive physical controls may be required. We must also rely on our defense in depth strategy for protecting our PC applications, including our communications applications, from compromise. Physical disablement such as unplugging from the PC, using a physical mute switch, or covering a camera could work if using external devices. However, this mitigation would not work for embedded microphones and cameras as is the trend in laptops and monitors today. While it may not be easily feasible to physically disable an embedded microphone, the lens of an embedded camera can be covered. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information in aural or visual form&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target Cisco Unified Personal Communicator [UC]</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA FSO</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>Cisco Unified Personal Communicator [UC]</dc:subject><dc:identifier>1826</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20328r1_fix">Ensure auto-answer capabilities of any voice, video, VTC, UC, or collaboration applications are disabled in the event the application provides audio or video communications services such that the microphone and/or camera could be activated automatically when an incoming call is received.

Have the IAO or SA demonstrate the operation of the PC communications client applications on PCs in the organization, to determine how they function with regard to the “auto-answer” feature, how the feature is configured, and if it is a user configurable setting.

Optimally, the design would place a DHCP server dedicated to providing IP address and configuration information to the VVoIP endpoints separate from the IP address and configuration information to data hosts (workstations etc.). The DHCP server providing VVoIP devices should be in the V_VUC domain having the same address space and VLAN to prevent DHCP requests routed onto the data environment that degrade the separation of the VVoIP environment and the data environment. With centralized management of DHCP (and other services, such as DNS) this separation is obviously eliminated. DHCP requests and responses for voice must reside on a segregated VLAN.
 
The best practice is to manually assign addresses when authorizing the instrument by generating its configuration file. In the event a dedicated DHCP server for VVoIP endpoints is not implemented, the network (i.e., the router controlling access to and from the VVoIP endpoint VLANs) must route VVoIP endpoint DHCP requests directly to the DHCP server in such a manner that prevents traffic to flow between the VVoIP and data VLANs.

Review VVoIP network design to determine the IP address the of VVoIP DHCP server. Alternately, determine the VLAN tag the VVoIP DHCP server uses or responds to or inspect the Ethernet port configuration of the LAN network equipment connected to the DHCP server to determine the VLAN assigned to the port. If the DHCP server’s IP address is not within the designated VVoIP VLAN structure or IP address range, this is a finding.

Inspect the configuration of all DHCP servers within the enclave to determine their address scope(s), and placement within the network for the VVoIP, data, or other VLANs.

Also previously stated is the requirement that the LAN NEs maintain the separation between management network(s) and the production network VLANs by blocking traffic from passing between them. Maintaining this separation is also incumbent upon the managed devices that are connected to both the management and production VLANs.

Individual VVoIP system core devices and traditional TDM based telecom switches connect to their production and management networks or VLANs in different ways. In some cases there are separate dedicated physical management and production interfaces. There may also be one or more physically separate management interfaces. On the other hand these interfaces may be logical or there may be some combination of logical and physical interfaces that support the required production and management traffic. In the event production and management connections use separate interfaces, whether logical or physical, the target/ managed device must not permit one network (physical or logical VLAN) to access another network through the device. That is, the device must not route IP traffic between logical or physical interfaces connected to different VLANs or physical networks that are part of a different logical security zone (protected VLAN) or physical network enclave.

Permitting such routing permit a host on one network or VLAN to gain unauthorized access to a host on another network which can lead to complete corruption of the accessed system or device causing the, loss of availability (denial-of-service), integrity, and information or communications confidentiality.

NOTE: While this specifically addresses a similar situation addressed in the Network Infrastructure STIG that essentially requires that the production side of a managed device must not be accessible from the management interface and vise versa, this requirement extends that requirement to multiple management interfaces. Many DSN switches and DISN IPVS system core devices are managed from the BCPS network and CCSA NOC via one interface and also monitored and potentially managed by the DISA ADIMSS or other NOC. These are separate enclaves which must be protected from inappropriate access between them. In some cases the connections from these enclaves to the managed devices are via separate interfaces on the managed devices. Ergo the requirement the managed device must not pass traffic between these interfaces.

Connect a network scanner to each network or interface in sequence. Scan the IP range(s) of the network(s) connected to the other port(s) on the VVoIP core system/device.

This is a finding in the event the scanner can reach any host on the scanned network.

Procedural example:
1 - Connect the scanner to the production network or connection of the VVoIP core system/device. Scan the address range of the management VLAN or network and any other management network connected to the target. 
1A - If the target device has redundant production interfaces, repeat step 1 for the second interface. 
2 - Connect the scanner to the management network interface and scan the address ranges of the production network and any other attached management networks. 
2A - If there is a second management network connection repeat step 2 for the second management interface.

The expected results are that the scanner should not report or reach any host on the scanned network(s).

NOTE: While a portion of this test might be performed as part of the scan used to check that the VVoIP production and management VLANs are closed thus validating the ACL requirements (providing the proper address ranges are scanned as noted above) a detailed review of the scan results would be required to identify if the hosts that were reached. Additional applicability of that test to this one is dependant upon where in the production or management VLAN the scanner is placed since the ACLS protecting the target VVoIP core device may mask a problem in the target device itself. Therefore it is recommended that an independent scan of the device be performed.

The email user can then open the attachment and listen to the voicemail on their PC or whatever device that provides properly authenticated access to the user’s email. 

Since the voicemail server must access the voice network (which, in a VoIP system is the VoIP VLAN system), and the data network (data VLANs) to send the email, caution and control must be exercised to not degrade the separation between the voice and data VLANs. Additionally, if the email server is part of or collocated with the voicemail server, user access to email must also not degrade the separation between the voice and data VLANs. Since this server may have 2 NICs and be connected to both voice and data VLANs, the server must not act as a bridge between the voice and data VLANs.

This is done so that a PC and a workstation can share a single network cable drop and LAN access layer switch port. The PC port can, in general, support any device requiring an Ethernet connection.  In theory, a VoIP phone, a desktop VTC unit could be daisy chained on a single LAN drop.  

These embedded multi-port Ethernet switches must be capable of maintaining the separation of the voice (VVoIP), data, VLANs as well as the VTC VLAN and PC Comm Client VLAN if present. For example the attached PC must not be able to directly access the phone’s or VTU’s configurations or communications traffic. VAN separation helps to prevent this.

NOTE: the switch or endpoint will typically utilize 802.1Q trunking (VLAN tagging) but may use some other means to separate voice and data traffic. Typically when 802.1Q VLAN tagging is used, the phone firmware tags the VoIP packets while the embedded switch passes all packets without modification. This permits devices connected to the PC port to tag their packets and assign the proper VLAN to their traffic type. 802.1Q VLAN tagging enables the LAN to better maintain separation of the traffic and is therefore the preferred method.

The LAN access switch (discrete NE or module in a larger NE) must be capable of, and must be configured to, support the VLAN separation method used by the supported endpoints. The NE may perform this function in various ways as determined by the overall VVoIP system and LAN design. However, the typical (or preferred) method used by an endpoint to maintain VLAN separation is 802.1Q VLAN tagging. As such, the LAN access port and NE needs to support the receipt of tagged packets and handle them appropriately to also maintain VLAN separation. While the NE may retag the packets thereby reassigning the VLAN based on some defined rule, the NE may not strip the tags and mix all traffic together. Furthermore, The LAN access NE supporting LAN cable drops will typically have a VLAN defined for each service (VVoIP, VTC, Data, PC Comm. Client) supported by the endpoints connected to the NE.

VLAN “hopping” occurs when a tagged frame destined for one VLAN is redirected to a different VLAN, threatening network security. The redirection can be initiated using two methods: “tagging attack” and “double encapsulation.” Frame tagging attacks allow a malicious user on a VLAN to get unauthorized access to another VLAN. For example, if a switch port’s trunk mode were configured as auto (enables a port to become a trunk if the connected switch it is negotiating trunking with has its state set to on or desirable) and were to receive a fake DTP packet specifying trunk on or desirable, it would become a trunk port and it could then start accepting traffic destined for all VLANs that belong to that trunk group. The attacker could start communicating with other VLANs through that compromised port—including the management VLAN. Insuring that trunk mode for any non-trunking port is configured as off can prevent this type of attack. Double encapsulation can be initiated by an attacker who has access to a switch port belonging to the native VLAN of the trunk port. Knowing the victim’s MAC address and with the victim attached to a different switch belonging to the same trunk group, thereby requiring the trunk link and frame tagging, the malicious user can begin the attack by sending frames with two sets of tags. The outer tag that is the attacker’s VLAN ID (probably the well known and omnipresent VLAN 1)  is stripped off by the switch, and the inner tag that will have the victim’s VLAN ID is used by the switch as the next hop and sent out the trunk port. To ensure the integrity of the trunk link and prevent unauthorized access, the native VLAN of the trunk port should be changed from the default VLAN 1  to its own unique VLAN. NOTE: Trunk mode is typically used between LAN switches to extend defined VLANs across a network. This mode is used to interconnect LAN switches and routers with other LAN switches and routers to create a network across multiple NEs. Trunk mode generally requires each packet to be tagged with the VLAN ID that it belongs to. This tagging can follow the 802.1Q standard format or can use a vendor proprietary protocol such as Cisco’s ISL. Access mode on the other hand is used on a switchport that supports a connection to a LAN endpoint device. Typically single endpoint devices connected to a switchport send traffic that does not contain a VLAN tag. In this case, if a VLAN is defined for the endpoint, the switchport is statically assigned to a VLAN. As such, when a packet is received and sent out the “Trunk” the packet is tagged with the VLAN ID. Best practices dictate that the implementation of VVoIP on a network requires one or more VVoIP VLANs be established within the network. Therefore LAN access switchports that support VVoIP and VTC endpoints that do not tag or are capable but not configured to add a VLAN tag to their traffic must be statically assigned to the local VVoIP VLAN. VVoIP  and VTC endpoints that do have the capability of adding the VLAN tag to their traffic typically use 802.1Q format and also typically support a PC port on the device. The PC port is added to the VVoIP or VTC endpoints since it reduces cabling and LAN infrastructure cost. Typically, VVoIP or VTC endpoints that support a PC port pass traffic from this port unchanged whether the traffic is tagged or not, while adding the VVoIP VLAN tag for the locally defined VVoIP VLAN to its VVoIP traffic. As such, a LAN access switchport must now support tagged and untagged traffic and keep the traffic separated. This is done by defining a default “data” VLAN (that is not the default VLAN on the NE such as VLAN 0 or 1) for the switchport in which untagged traffic is placed and defining a secondary VVoIP VLAN that matches the 802.1Q tag used for the VVoIP  traffic. This method maintains the LAN access nature of the port even though it supports multiple VLANs while not requiring it to be configured as a trunk. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.

Doing so permits a PC to share the same LAN drop as a VoIP phone or desktop VTC endpoint. The net effect is reduced installation and maintenance cost for the LAN infrastructure. Endpoints that provide a PC port have an embedded Ethernet switch which is required to support the separation of the PC data traffic from the VVoIP and VTC traffic. This is primarily accomplished by the embedded Ethernet switch in the endpoint supporting VLANs. In support of this, many VVoIP and VTC endpoints have the capability of adding a VLAN tag to their traffic using the 802.1Q format. Typically the PC port traffic is passed to the LAN unchanged whether the traffic is tagged or not, while adding the VVoIP VLAN tag for the locally defined VVoIP VLAN to its VVoIP traffic. 

NOTE: this is a limitation of the switchport access mode. It seems that configuring more than a default and tagged VLAN on a switchport requires the port to be set as a trunk, which is not permissible based on NET1416. This causes a limitation in the number of devices and applications that can be supported by a single switchport and LAN drop. For example, a single switchport will support a single VoIP phone (w/ an embedded switch and PC port) which tags its traffic and a connected PC that does not. Similarly, a single switchport will support a single VTC endpoint (w/ an embedded switch and PC port) which tags its traffic and a connected PC that does not. Similarly, a single switchport will support a single PC that supports a soft phone and tags its VoIP traffic while not tagging its data traffic (per the PCCC STIG). A single port will not support a VoIP phone and a VTC endpoint and a PC on a single drop unless the VTC endpoint also tags its VTC traffic with the VoIP VLAN. If a PC with a compliant soft phone is connected, it must also tag its traffic with the single VoIP VLAN tag. 

NOTE: Traffic to/from a VTC endpoint may use the same VLAN as the VVoIP phone system. Some exceptions may apply. NOTE: Do not use the default VLAN for the switch which is generally VLAN 1. This is used for LAN control traffic. No traffic or interface is permitted to be assigned to the switches’ default VLAN.

One of the methods is MAC based port security which limits the number of devices that can be connected to a LAN drop and LAN access switchport thereby protecting the LAN by providing a measure of access control. Allowing too many MAC addresses on a switch port could allow a mini-hub or switch to be added to the voice VLAN port or PC/data port on a VVoIP  or VTC endpoint to which additional unauthorized devices or workstations to be connected. Thus, the entire VVoIP or VTC systems or the LAN may be compromised. This requirement works in association with the NI STIG requirements on MAC based port security. In some cases this requirement might conflict with or modify the requirements contained therein. This is because the focus of the NI STIG is data networks where typically only one data device is authorized to connect to any given LAN drop. This follows through for VVoIP or VTC endpoints providing the workspace in which they are to be installed is provisioned with enough LAN drops to support the number of devices to be used in the workspace. This also requires that each LAN drop that is to be used must be connected to a LAN access switchport. In such a scenario, it is best practice to limit the devices that are permitted to connect to any given LAN drop/switchport combination to one. There are two methods for effecting this limitation. The first is to statically map the MAC address of a pre-authorized device into the configuration of the PAN access switchport. The second method is called sticky (MAC based) port security in which the MAC address of the first device to connect to the switchport is learned and added to the configuration. This becomes the authorized device. Sticky port security requires that care be exercised regarding what device is connected to a port for the first time. In both cases an alarm will be generated if an unauthorized device is connected. Many VVoIP or VTC endpoints provide an extra Ethernet port called a PC port that permits the endpoint and a PC (or other device) to share the same LAN drop. This has several advantages. First, a VVoIP or VTC endpoint can be added to a LAN that heretofore only supported PCs without having to run additional cable or activate additional LAN drops. This provides a cost savings in both initial installation and operating costs for the LAN infrastructure. This is because this method reduces the number of active LAN access switchports thereby reducing energy consumption. This reduction not only reduces the energy needed to operate the LAN equipment but the energy required to cool the equipment is reduced thereby providing another reduction (or lack of increase) in energy usage and operating cost. Sharing LAN drops is green. There are other devices such as access control devices that can also share a LAN drop. It is possible to share a single LAN drop with a VVoIP endpoint, a desktop VTC endpoint, and a PC. The following limitations for MAC based port security are to be implemented to support VVoIP or VTC endpoints in various scenarios: &gt; A single authorized VVoIP or VTC endpoint on a LAN drop/switchport requires one MAC to be statically configured or the learned maximum set to one whether it provides a PC port or not. In this case the PC port is disabled. Connecting a device to the PC port will cause an alarm. &gt; A single VVoIP or VTC endpoint on a LAN drop/switchport that provides a PC port to which a PC will be connected will require two statically mapped MAC addresses or a maximum of three dynamically learned addresses. While there are two authorized devices permitted to connect, the endpoint address may be learned twice in association with the data VLAN and the VVoIP or VTC VLAN. &gt; In the event a VVoIP endpoint, VTC endpoint, and a PC are to be daisy chained on one LAN drop/switchport and switchport, the switchport will need to be configured for 3 statically mapped addresses or a maximum of 5 dynamically learned MAC addresses. This is because both the VVoIP and VTC endpoints will typically be assigned to the VVoIP VLAN due to switchport mode configuration limitations and both endpoints may be learned twice in association with the data VLAN and the VVoIP or VTC VLAN. NOTE: another green initiative where a single LAN drop is shared among several devices is called "hot desking" which is related to conservation of office space and teleworking. Hot desking is where several people are assigned to work at the same desk at different times, each with their own laptop PC. In this case, a different MAC address needs to be permitted for each laptop that is supposed to connect to the LAN drop in the workspace. Additionally, this workspace could contain a single phone (and possibly desktop VTC endpoint) used by all assignees and the PC port on it might be the connection for their laptop. In this case it is best not to use sticky port security but to use a static mapping of pre-authorized devices or implement 802.1x. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.

The normal mitigation for this situation is to not implement VVoIP or VTC endpoints that provides a PC port if 802.1x is implemented as the LAN access control method. In the event a PC port is provided, the mitigation is to disable the port. However, the 802.1x implementation must install the configuration on the LAN access switchport that is required to support a VVoIP or VTC endpoint with a disabled PC port. This means that the required configuration for the LAN access switchports is to configure the appropriate VLAN for the VVoIP or VTC traffic (as required) as well as configuring the “unused” VLAN for the disabled PC port (as required). NOTE: the prohibition discussed here could be lifted (eliminated) in the event one of the following occurs: 1 - The LAN switchport can authorize access at the VLAN level and be reconfigured as additional devices are connected. That is, the switchport is activated and the VVoIP or VTC VLAN is configured/activated when the endpoint  is authenticated/authorized but the data VLAN for the PC port is set to the “unused” VLAN until the PC or other device is connected. When a device is connected to the PC port, it must then use 802.1x to gain access to the LAN. Once authenticated and authorized, the LAN switchport is reconfigured with the active e data VLAN if a PC is connected. This process could, in theory, also support a VVoIP, VTC endpoint, and PC daisy chained on one LAN port if each was authenticated to the LAN one at a time in sequence from the LAN drop out. 2 - The VVoIP or VTC endpoint’s embedded switch and the PC port fully supports 802.1x as an authenticator. That is the PC port works like an 802.1x capable LAN access switchport and can be activated and deactivated (configured) by the 802.1x authentication server.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.

Additionally, some IP hardware phones are only capable of providing basic layer 2 connectivity, acting like a hub and combining the data and voice network segments. While other IP phones offer enhanced Layer 2 connectivity providing the option to use VLAN technology, to place the phone and the data traffic on two different VLANs. To ensure logical separation of voice and data in order to maintain the security of the VoIP environment, only layer 2 enhanced or VLAN capable phones should be considered for use. Many attacks on DOD computer systems are launched from within the network by dissatisfied or disgruntled employees, therefore, it is imperative that any active IP Phone data ports be disabled the same as unused physical ports on a network switch. If unauthorized personnel gain access to the VoIP or data environment through an unsecured data port, they could cause disruptions, denial of service conditions, or access sensitive information. Disabling data ports on IP Phones prevents this type of unauthorized and unwanted activity. 

NOTE: It is not typical that the PC port will be used on all endpoints. For example, phones and VTC units in offices typically might be used, while phones in common areas such as a lobby, hallway, or kitchen, etc. will not. Phones and VTC units in conference rooms may or may not, depending upon site policy. In general, these PC ports are the most vulnerable to unauthorized use, and therefore should be disabled until actually required to be used by an authorized LAN user.

The following is a summary:

The typical data firewall does not adequately protect the enclave when permitting VVoIP to traverse the boundary. Furthermore this firewall breaks VVoIP call completion, particularly if NAT/NAPT is implemented.

To properly protect the enclave when implementing VVoIP across the boundary, there are a specific set of processes and protections required as discussed earlier. For the purpose of this document, this set of processes and protections is referred to as the VVoIP firewall function. These are different from the data firewall processes and protections which are referred to as the data firewall function. These sets of processes and protections are defined as functions and not as discrete devices. This is primarily because as firewall platforms and their computing processors become faster and more robust, we do not want to limit the DoD from implementing a vendor’s product that can effectively support both sets of functions on the same platform.

The data firewall function plays a part in the protection of the VVoIP sub-enclave within the LAN while the VVoIP firewall function protects the entire enclave while permitting the VVoIP system to function properly.

As such data firewall function must bock all traffic to/from the VVoIP VLANs and/or address space except as follows:
• Signaling, media, registration protocols, UC protocols, etc to/from a remote endpoint entering the enclave via a properly authenticated VPN tunnel. In this case, such traffic is blocked from the data VLAN(s) and routed to the VVoIP VLANs unless there is an EBC (VoIP firewall) in which case session traffic must be routed through the EBC.
• Management traffic to/from a remote NOC destined for the VVoIP management VLAN address space. In this case, the data firewall and IDS inspects this traffic before it is routed to the VVoIP management VLAN. Such routing must block all traffic from the data VLAN/subnets and the general data network management VLAN(s). 
• Protected LSC to LSC communications (e.g., database replication) between LSCs that are clustered across the WAN
• The enclave is connected to a limited access / closed WAN (e.g., a classified WAN) AND the WAN has a dedicated address space for VVoIP (e.g., SIPRNet).

This is because only newer routers are capable of dealing with service classes and expedited forwarding. This why the DISN IPVS PMO specifies the specific additional capabilities required of the perimeter or premise router to support the needs of the Assures Service network. The router designated by the DISN IPVS PMO that is needed to support the service is called the Customer Edge Router (CER).

While the EBC is also required to authenticate the source and integrity of the signaling packets it receives, filtering on source IP address adds a layer of protection for the MFSS. This is also a backup measure in the event this filtering is not done on the CER.

&gt; Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to interrogate the ability of another MFSS or a LSC to receive a call, whether routine or priority.

If so, it signals to establish the call. If the destination is not one of its LSCs it signals with other MFSSs to locate the destination LSC and then the remote MFSS negotiates with its LSC. 
&gt; Acts as a backup MFSS for LSCs assigned to other MFSSs as primary. As such, a LSC must be able to signal with a MFSS in order to establish any call across the DISN WAN. LSCs do not interact directly with LSCs. This hierarchical arrangement is required in order to be able to manage and establish priority calls and manage access circuit budgets. We established previously that each LSC must have a backup MFSS. In support of this function MFSSs must be operated in pairs with all the information about its assigned LSCs replicated across the pair.

This is a two-part process that is exacerbated if the call originates from a Multi-Line Telephone System (MLTS). Some of the FCC rules and state laws address the MLTS issue.
For enterprise systems, the support for E911 by the enterprise LSC (or any remote LSC construct) is governed by FCC rules, as well as other federal, state, and local law. The design and implementation of all MLTS systems must include reasonable efforts to provide E911, even when the access connection to the Enterprise LSC is severed.

Public enhanced F&amp;ES systems are implemented in conjunction with the local exchange carrier (LEC) using their central office switch (CO). When the designated F&amp;ES number is dialed, the CO routes the call to the public F&amp;ES answering point (PSAP) over special trunks that can provide the PSAP with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated and the geographic location of the originating telephone. The originating telephone number is provided as Automatic Number Identification (ANI) information. The geographic location of the originating telephone is provided as Automatic Location Identification (ALI) information. The ALI is generated from the ANI by looking up the ANI in a database. Typically this function is performed by the LEC and the ALI provided is the service delivery address for the telephone number. In some cases the ALI information is housed in a database at the PSAP or a at a third party provider such that the PSAP must make the “database dip” to identify the location of the caller. The information is regularly updated by the LEC based on new service deliveries and disconnections.

This process does not go far enough if the originating telephone is behind (part of) a MLTS. An MLTS may serve a large building or may serve multiple buildings in a campus setting. It may also serve small or large remote sites that are geographically distant from the main MLTS switch. As discussed above, the normal process provides the address where the LEC delivers its phone service for the calling number. While this address will serve to get emergency services personnel to the lobby of a building or the front gate of a campus, it will not provide the exact location of the caller. This is where the federal and state MLTS related requirements come in. Under these rules, a MLTS operator and the system itself must provide complete ANI and ALI information to the answering point such that emergency services personnel can easily locate the caller. As such the MLTS must provide the exact location of the originating telephone minimally within a reasonably small area of it. The location information provided for telephones behind a MLTS is called Phone Switch-ALI (PS-ALI). 

To implement this, the MLTS must first be able to provide the F&amp;ES answering station with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated via ANI. If the answering point is outside the MLTS, the number provided must be the exact Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number of the telephone placing the call so that the answering point can dial it directly. The number provided must not be that of an outbound trunk. Secondly, this phone number must be correlated to its physical address or location within the facility via PS-ALI. 

To implement PS-ALI, the owner/operator of a MLTS is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date database containing the telephone number (DID number and/or extension number) and physical location of each telephone attached to the MLTS. This database is then used to provide the PS-ALI information to the ALI database(s) accessed by the F&amp;ES answering point. In association with each telephone and telephone number in the MLTS, the PS-ALI information contained in the database includes the following:
 - The address of the site containing the MLTS unless provided to the answering point by the LEC as part of its ANI/ALI information.
 - The name (or number) of the building in which the telephone is located.
 - The address of the building in which the telephone is located.
 - The floor in the building on which the telephone is located.
 - The area or quadrant of the floor where the telephone is located.
 - The room or cube number where the telephone is located.

Additional information should be provided to the F&amp;ES answering point and emergency services personnel in the form of up-to-date facility maps and floor plans. The maintenance of facility maps, floor plans, and PS-ALI information to keep them up-to-date is critical to life safety and facility protection and security. This can be an onerous process in light of changes in the facility and moves, adds, and changes within the MLTS. Maintaining accurate location information is exacerbated in a VoIP MLTS due to the ability of an IP phone to change its physical location within the LAN (and possibly beyond) while keeping its telephone number without specific intervention from, or knowledge of the MLTS operator. As such the PS_ALI database can quickly become inaccurate. A situation that could be life threatening. 

Automated systems can be used with a VoIP system and LAN to identify the general location of an IP phone within the facility based on the LAN switch and port to which the phone is connected.

Verify the local DoD Multi-Line Telecommunications System (MLTS), VoIP or traditional, routes calls to the designated local emergency services number at the public and private emergency services answering point (PSAP) as a priority call in a non-blocking manner. If an emergency services number is not designated to access an emergency services answering point or call center whether internal to the local site or to another local agency or municipality, this is a finding. If calls to this number are not treated as a priority call in a non-blocking manner, this is also a finding.

NOTE: In the event the F&amp;ES calls are routed to a public entity outside the MLTS, the call must route to an internal emergency number in parallel with the external call. Both calls should have the same priority. This is so that the site can be aware of the emergency and assist the F&amp;ES responders in reaching the location of the caller. F&amp;ES calls may be routed to an internal on-site F&amp;ES answering point providing the site maintains robust local police, fire, and medical services such that these can replace public services. In the event a public F&amp;ES answering point is the primary answering point for the site, calls must be directly routed to it and not relayed via a local emergency answering point. A second call from the local emergency answering point should not be required to obtain emergency services from the public F&amp;ES answering point unless the site maintains full and comparable police, fire, and medical services and its answering point is the primary. In the event a local private answering point is the primary answering point, and if this private answering point is not fully staffed on a 24-7 basis, the MLTS must route F&amp;ES calls to the public answering point when the local answering point is not fully staffed, for example outside the normal working hours of the site. </check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-21513"><title>Deficient security: SIP Cross Site Scripting</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-23722r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1980 (GENERAL)</version><title>Devices and applications using SIP or AS-SIP signaling are vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;A cross site scripting vulnerability has been demonstrated in at least one SIP based IP phone. The vulnerability was demonstrated by adding scripting code to the From: field in the SIP invite. Upon receiving the invite, the embedded code was executed by a “vulnerable embedded web server” to download additional malicious code and affect an attack.  A desktop demonstration of the vulnerability also exists on www.securityfocus.com under Bugtraq ID: 25987 that benignly pops up an alert box containing the word “HACK” on the user’s workstation after downloading a SIP invite. 

While this vulnerability was demonstrated on a specific IP phone it could potentially affect all SIP based endpoints or clients and their signaling partners. This vulnerability is a result of improper filtering or validation of the content of the various fields in the SIP invite and potentially the Session Description Protocol (SDP) portion of the invite. The injected code could cause all sorts of malicious code to be run on the target device which could be an endpoint (hard or soft), a session controller, or any other SIP signaling partner. Additionally this vulnerability may affect other applications other than VoIP that use SIP such as IM clients and others. A similar vulnerability would result if URLs embedded in SIP messages were launched automatically.

Traditional phone service, whether from a LEC or from a PBX is generally always available in a power failure since the endpoint or subscriber instrument is powered from the telephone switch. Traditionally, telephone switches are provided with considerable backup power. While feature phones and some digital phones need local power, for the most part all analog phones and others powered by the switch always work when primary power is out. Traditional phomne service only requires power at the switch and endpoint. Not so for VVoIP service. VVoIP service is disrupted when power to the LAN infrastructure is disrupted. This can happen at various points since the LAN is a distributed (non-centralized) network. When implementing a VVoIP system without considering UPS power needs for the VVoIP controllers and endpoints as well as entire LAN, and supporting those needs with UPSs, we are reducing the availability of the telecommunications service. This reduction in availability threatens facility and personal security and safety as well as life safety during a power failure.

&gt; All VVoIP system devices including voice endpoints and portions of the LAN that supports C2R and non-C2/admin users are provided some reasonable level of UPS in support of emergency life-safety and security communications during a power failure 

NOTE: UPS in support of C2R and non-C2/admin users’ endpoints is best provided using POE particularly if supporting the general population. (Probably more cost effective than a battery under every desk). While support of all such endpoints and infrastructure is desirable since this provides greater availability, the cost could become a negating factor. In this case, a portion of the regular endpoints or emergency use endpoints could be provided at strategic locations within the facility to fulfill the requirement to support emergency life-safety and security communications.

This is a finding in the event, based on the interview; it is determined that portions of the VVoIP system or LAN have not been provided sufficient backup power such that emergency life-safety and security communications can be completed during a reasonable period of time at the beginning of a power failure. A reasonable period of time should have minimum duration of 15 minutes with a target of half hour to an hour.

NOTE: The requirement here for UPS support for C2R or Non-C2/admin users communications is negated in the event that such users have an alternate reliable means of communicating in such situations. Personal and potentially even government provided cell phones are not the answer since there are many locations in DoD facilities where they are prohibited and/or signal availability is unreliable. An alternative to this could be to put a policy and SOP into effect that requires such users to evacuate the facility to a location where the appropriate communications capability is available.

This is useful when a person is visiting a remote office away from their normal office and typically functions within an established enterprise wide VVoIP system where the system is designed as a contiguous system. In this case, the system is typically a single vendor solution. The system might be within one LAN/CAN may include multiple LAN/CANs at multiple interconnected sites. To activate this feature, the user approaches a phone that is not their regular phone and identifies themselves to the phone system via a username, password, pin, code, or some combination of these. Upon validation, the system configuration manager will configure the temporary phone to match the configuration of the user’s regular phone. Minimally, the phone number is transferred and possibly some or all of the user’s speed dial numbers and other personal preferences. This capability is dependant upon the capabilities of the temporary phone. Once activated the user’s inbound calls are directed to the temporary location. The user’s regular phone may or may not maintain its normal capabilities and also may also answer inbound calls.

NOTE: This feature has nothing to do with LAN access control and is not related to moving physical phones/endpoints/instruments. The phone that is already in the temporary location is already authorized on the LAN and registered with the LSC. Moving phones requires pre-authorization and pre-configuration of the LAN access control mechanisms, potentially including the LSC. This feature should not be used to permanently move users from one office to another. 

NOTE: Extension mobility is similar to but not the same as forwarding ones calls. Forwarding is typically activated from the user’s normal phone or their user preferences configuration settings. Forwarding is therefore pre-set to a known location. Extension mobility is typically activated from the remote location and is activated upon arrival at that location.

Extension mobility poses some vulnerabilities to the VVoIP system, user’s profile information, and conversations if not properly controlled. 

Extension mobility should be available only to those individuals that need to use the feature. There should be a configurable checkbox that enables/disables the feature within the configuration of the user’s normal phone or within the user’s profile. Making the feature available to all users all of the time broadens the exposure for potential compromise of other user’s profile information or conversations.

Activation of the feature must not be via a feature button on the temporary phone or a commonly known code, either of which might be used along with the phone number to be transferred. This would leave all regular user’s phones vulnerable to anybody activating the feature from anywhere in the system to eavesdrop or collect information.

Extension mobility transfer in some systems may have no time limitation. This means the temporary user’s phone configuration, preferences, speed dial information, and phone calls are available at the temporary phone until the transfer feature is deactivated. In the event the user does not specifically deactivate the transfer when they leave, the info is there until someone else deactivates it or another transfer is activated. While users should have the capability to deactivate the transfer at their discretion when they leave, the system should automatically deactivate the feature at some predetermined time of day or after a time period of inactivity. A timed deactivation might use a period of inactivity of one or two hours. Activation of the feature might be for a given period of time, such as eight hours, or for a user configurable time period set when they activate the feature. A time of day deactivation could be set to deactivate all such transfers at midnight each day. This feature might also be used as a backup for other methods.

In the event controls such as those discussed above are not available, an extension mobility feature should be deactivated if the feature is provided or supported by the system.
