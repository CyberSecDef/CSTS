MGCP is a clear text human readable protocol. This information is critical in the setup and completion of voice calls from one VoIP zone to another VoIP zone or more typically from a VoIP zone to a TDM zone. If this information is poisoned or if collected and used by an unauthorized unscrupulous individual, the effects to the VoIP environment could be detrimental. Denial-of-service or fraudulent system use are only two of the potential compromises. As such, MGCP messages must be protected from eavesdropping, man in the middle, and replay attacks. To protect MGCP, Request for Comment (RFC) 2705 which defines MGCP outlines and recommends the use of IPSec for encryption and authentication between gateways. This recommendation primarily applies to the use of MGCP across unprotected WANs like the Internet. This extends to use on NIPRNet as well. A follow-on protocol defined jointly by the IETF in RFC 3435 and the ITU-T in Recommendation H.248.1 is MEGACO/H.248 which provides the same general functionality as MGCP. RFC 3435 also requires that H.248 packets be authenticated and/or encrypted using IPSec. Unfortunately there is not widespread support by MGCs and MGs for IPSec protection and therefore we must rely on external IPSec VPNs when traversing the WAN. When confined within the LAN, we can protect MGCP in a number of ways without IPSec. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Denial of Service, loss of confidentiality, and/or unauthorized access to network or voice system resources or services and the information they contain.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECCT-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20185r1_fix">In the event MGCP or MEGACO/H.248 is used to control Media Gateways (MGs) or other devices (e.g., endpoints), ensure the following:

Documenting or logging physical access to these components is critical to determine accountability for auditing purposes. Key control and access logs are a large part of this. Additionally, the facilities housing the telecommunications infrastructure must be certified at a classification level commensurate with the highest classification level of the information communicated by the system.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;VVoIP networks increasingly represent high-value targets for attacks and represent a greater risk to network security than most other network applications; hence, it is imperative that the voice network and supporting data networks be secured as tightly as possible to reduce the impact that an attack can have on either network. Segregating voice traffic from data traffic greatly enhances the security and availability of all services. Further subdivision of the voice and data networks can further enhance security. Achieving the ideal security posture for voice and data would require two physically separate and distinct networks (including cable plant), much as is the case with traditional voice and data technologies. Although this might be considered for the most demanding security environments, it works against the idea of convergence and the associated cost savings expected by having one network (and cable plant). Logical segregation of VoIP components and data components can be accomplished at both layer 2 using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and layer 3 using IP addressing. While these methods, in themselves, are not designed as security mechanisms, they do provide a derived security benefit by easing management of filtering rules and obfuscating or hiding addresses and information that an attacker could use to facilitate an attack. Separation may also prevent an attack on one network from impacting the other. These methods make it harder for an attacker to be successful and help to provide a layered approach to VoIP and network security. Segregating data from telephony by placing VoIP servers and subscriber terminals on logically separate IP networks and logically separate Ethernet networks while controlling access to these VoIP components through filters will help to ensure security and aid in protecting the VoIP environment from external threats. In addition, further subdivision of those components is necessary to protect the telephony applications which are running across the infrastructure. Layer 3 address segregation is the first layer in our layered defense approach to VoIP security. It allows the use of switches, routers, and firewalls with their associated access lists and other processes, to control traffic between the components on the network. To provide address segregation, best practices dictate that all like components will be placed in like address ranges. Therefore VoIP components (i.e., Gatekeepers, Call Managers, voice mail systems, IP Subscriber Terminals etc.) will be deployed within their own, separate private IP network, logical sub-network, or networks. The combination of logical data and voice segmentation via addressing and VLANs coupled with a switched and routed infrastructure strongly mitigates call eavesdropping and other attacks. In addition, limiting logical access to VoIP components is necessary for protecting telephony applications running across the infrastructure. Segregating data from telephony by placing VoIP servers and subscriber terminals on logically separate IP networks while controlling access to these VoIP components through IP filters will help to ensure security and aid in protecting the VoIP environment.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, DCPA-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20236r2_fix">Implement VVoIP systems and components on a logically segregated and dedicated VVoIP network.

The layer 2 switches found at the access layer provide high port density for both host and IP phone connectivity as well as layer 2 services such as QoS and VLAN membership. (It should also be mentioned that some access layer switches can also do layer 2 and 3 filtering.) Guidelines and requirements for securing access layer devices including any associated cross-connect hardware can be found in the Network Infrastructure STIG. Layer 2 network segregation is the second layer in our layered defense approach to VoIP security. Voice traffic must be isolated from data traffic using separate physical LANs or Virtual LANs. The combination of data and voice segregation and segmentation using VLANs along with a switched infrastructure strongly enhances the security posture of the system. This will also help to mitigate call eavesdropping and other attacks. VLAN technology has traditionally been an efficient way of grouping users into workgroups to share a specific network address space and broadcast domain regardless of their physical location on the network. Hosts within the same VLAN can communicate with other hosts in the same VLAN using layer-2 switching. To communicate with other VLANs, traffic must go through a layer 3 device where it can be filtered and routed. VLANs can offer significant benefits in a multi-service network by providing a convenient way of isolating VVoIP equipment and traffic from the data equipment and traffic. When VLANs are deployed, excessive broadcast and multicast packets present in the normal data traffic will not disrupt IPT services. As with data networks, IPT equipment and instruments should be logically grouped using multiple VLANs such that IP Phones share their VLANs only with other IP Phones, gateways with like gateways, and so on. Each type of VVoIP device would have mutually exclusive VLANs. This forces layer 3 routing and thereby enables all the filtering capabilities of the layer 3 devices. Additionally, each server type should have its own VLAN. Private server VLANs would prevent a compromised server from attacking another server on the same VLAN at layer two. Since all the devices on any given VLAN would have the same Layer 2 through 4 (at least) characteristics the filtering rules become easier to develop, deploy, and manage. Additionally, the implementation of VLANs helps to mitigate the risk of attacks sourced from the data VLANs such as virus driven DoS attack or packet sniffing. In addition, placing voice and data traffic into separate VLANs will reduce competition for the network and thus reduce latency (queue/wait time) for transmission services, which will reduce the possibility of denial of voice services. This also reduces the Ethernet broadcast domain thereby reducing network overhead. Since VoIP is very latency sensitive this segmentation approach is the most economical way to improve performance in an existing network infrastructure. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;This finding can be reduced to a cat III in the event the system minimally implements one VLAN for endpoints and one for the core equipment.

This may not be a finding under certain circumstances such as in the case of a small footprint tactical system where there are a limited number of VVoIP instruments (i.e., 20).

Based on the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) requirement that the Unified Capabilities (UC) application tag its signaling and media traffic with the proper UCR defined Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP), the LAN access switch port must route the UC traffic to the voice/video VLAN.

NOTE: Hardware based VTC endpoints that utilize LSC services for session control may reside in the VoIP endpoint VLANs. These may include desktop and “executive” or office based units. All other Hardware based VTC endpoints require their own dedicated network or VLAN. 

NOTE: Separate VLANs work in conjunction with the dedicated address space discussed earlier to provide the required effect. Each VLAN is configured with a subset of addresses (valid IP subnet) from the designated VVoIP address space
NOTE: Per NI STIG requirements the NE’s default VLAN (VLAN 0 or 1) will not be used for any of the required VVoIP, data, or VTC VLANs.

NOTE: ACLs are required between the various VLANs that will filter traffic between them based on what protocols and IP addresses are permitted to access or control the devices residing in the VLAN. Therefore it is expected that the LAN / VVoIP system design will include one or more routers or layer-3 switches as the intersection of all of these VLANs to access and traffic flow between them. This routing device will be configured with ACLs to only permit the functionally necessary traffic to flow between the various VLANs and the equipment they contain. 

NOTE: These VLANs may be replaced by direct connections to the VVoIP core routing devices so that the ACLs may be implemented on the physical interface to the device. This requires that such direct physical connections be given a discrete subnet. 

NOTE: The VLAN/subnets and associated ACLs need only to be assigned / applied for devices that exist in the VVoIP system. The VLAN / ACL design may change depending upon the location and physical makeup of the VVoIP core equipment. An example of this is if a MG and SG reside on the same platform and both use the same Ethernet LAN connections (and potentially the same or different IP address), then separate VLANs are not needed for the MG and SG but the ACL protecting them may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

This is a finding in the event the design or implementation of the VVoIP system and supporting LAN does not include the required VLANs and subnets based upon the equipment and services provided by or included in the VVoIP system. Size of the system or the number of users supported has no effect on the need for this segmentation. However under some circumstances such as in the case of a small deployable package the number of VLANs can be reduced based upon a benefit vs. risk assessment, AO approval, and package C&amp;A.

NOTE: The existence of the required VLANs will be validated in subsequent computing checks. The purpose of this check is to determine if the system design and implementation plan includes consideration for VLAN segmentation.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-8247"><title>Deficient design: VVOIP &amp; UC/UM server dedication</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-8733r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1050 (GENERAL)</version><title>Servers supporting the VVoIP and UC/UM telephony environment are not dedicated to telephony (VVoIP, UC, or UM) applications or their support.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;For the purpose of this requirement a VVoIP, UC, or UM server is any server directly supporting the communications service.

Information gleaned from signaling messages can be used to attack the system or for other nefarious reasons. If VVoIP traffic is passed in the clear it is open to sniffing attacks. This vulnerability exists whether the traffic is on a LAN/CAN or a MAN/WAN. Native end-to-end encryption of the signaling and media mitigates this vulnerability. As a secondary solution, mitigation can be accomplished at the link level through the incorporation of encrypted VPN tunneling technology. Both solutions are applicable when the communicating endpoints are operated by the same organization or they reside in enclaves operated by the same organization and the endpoints and supporting systems are interoperable. As such, encryption of some approved form is required to protect DoD-to-DoD communications across a public network such as the Internet or a publicly accessible network such as the NIPRnet.

While end-to-end application or protocol-level encryption is preferred, tunneling unencrypted VVOIP signaling and media traffic using FIPS-validated site-to-site or client-to-site (remote access) VPN technologies mitigates the risk. The inherent NSA-approved site-to-site encryption employed for classified networks, such as the SIPRnet, also meets this requirement, although such networks are not public or publicly accessible as a rule.

DoD-to-DoD voice communications are generally considered to contain sensitive information. Local DoD enclaves connect to a DISN SDN via an access circuit. Unless the site is a host to an SDN, or close enough to it to be served by DoD-owned facilities, some portion of the access circuit will use leased commercial facilities. Additionally, the DISN core network itself may traverse commercial services and facilities. Therefore, DoD voice and data traffic crossing the unclassified DISN must be encrypted.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;EBRU-1, ECCT-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20178r4_fix">Implement all DoD-to-DoD VVOIP signaling and media traffic traversing a public or publicly accessible WAN network (i.e., Internet, NIPRnet) to use FIPS-validated encryption for unclassified traffic or NSA-approved encryption for classified traffic, either natively at the application or protocol level, or by using network or data-link layer encryption (i.e., encrypted VPN or bulk link encryption).

NOTE: This requirement is applicable to the following: 
- Calls established between DoD endpoints within an extended enclave (single MILDEP organization using directly interoperable VoIP systems). 
- Calls established between DoD endpoints located in different enclaves operated by a single MILDEP organization using directly interoperable VoIP systems. 
- Calls established between DoD endpoints located in different enclaves operated by different MILDEP organizations whether using directly interoperable VoIP systems and endpoints or the systems are subscribers to the DISN IPVS using IPVS standard protocols. 
- Calls established between remote DoD endpoints located outside their home enclave and connecting across the Internet and/or NIPRnet. In this case, a remote access VPN is used. 

NOTE: At this time, this requirement is not applicable for calls established from DoD to commercial VoIP telephones via commercial ITSP services implemented as a replacement for TDM-based PSTN access. This is because there is no encryption standard for end-to-end VoIP sessions to which all ITSPs and phone vendors have subscribed. Once a universal standard is adopted and implemented, or translation gateways are developed, this requirement could then be applied. Before encryption standards are adopted, the world must adopt interoperable signaling and media standards. At this time, Session Border Controllers can provide some translation services. Additional considerations are discussed in the section on ITSP services.</check-content></check></Rule></Group><Group id="V-8253"><title>Deficient hardening: STIG appl’n to VM assets</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-8739r1_rule" severity="low" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1040 (GENERAL)</version><title>The stand alone or IP connected Voice mail system/server is not secured to applicable OS and DSN STIG guidance.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Voice mail services are subject to the guidance and requirements in the DSN STIG.

For example, a legacy voice mail platform can connect to a VoIP gateway to provide voice mail services for VoIP users. In the same respect, a VoIP based voice mail platform can provide voice mail services to the legacy voice users and the VoIP users. In addition to providing traditional voice mail services, many VoIP voice mail systems are also capable of providing unified mail (integrated voice and electronic mail), or by interacting with existing email messaging systems. Voice mail services are commonly configured to run on common operating systems, such as, Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Sun Solaris.

Control commands are dialed using the keypad and transmitted using Dial-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) audio tones. The voice greetings are transmitted using normal audio as well. The audio can be analog or digital, which is encoded in whatever coding scheme is used by the local PBX. In IP based phone systems access to the voicemail server carries the same vulnerabilities as the IP voice communications carried by the system. As such access to voicemail for the purpose of creating greeting messages, retrieving voicemail, or adjusting personal settings, must be encrypted on the IP network. In part this is because anyone with a sniffer and access to the right LAN segment can acquire the subscriber’s account and password information. With this intercepted information a hacker could gain access to the subscribers voice mail account, intercept sensitive information, and/or perform other destructive actions. Once access to settings is achieved there the intruder could change greetings or possibly forward all voicemails received.

Encryption of the voice message traffic as well as control from the phone’s dial-pad falls under the normal requirement for the encryption of VoIP signaling and media.

In the event the subscriber’s personal settings are accessible via a “web” connection using a browser on the subscriber’s desktop or phone, the connection must use HTTPS and TLS minimally to protect the user’s logon credentials. Additionally, the voicemail system/server, which provides this service via a web server application, must be configured in accordance with the “private web server” requirements in the Web Server STIG/Checklist.

Many government entities use mobile communication solutions that include wireless VVoIP and Unified Communications (UC) applications to meet critical needs for interoperability and flexibility. Smartphone vendors integrate Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile radio that transitions seamlessly for VVoIP and UC apps. Using these capabilities over wireless technologies presents vulnerabilities to the communications carried and the VVoIP infrastructure. Confidentiality is one of the greatest concerns requiring encryption of the media and signaling. This encryption is in addition to the WLAN encryption required by the Wireless STIG and the endpoints must authenticate to the WLAN before being granted access. Another great concern for using wireless VVoIP communications services is reliability and availability when using the technology for critical C2 communications. Initiated calls could be blocked at either the transmitting end or the receiving end. This could be because the spectrum or channels could be busy/overloaded, unavailable, or deliberately jammed by an adversary.

Determine if the site has implemented or supports IP based wireless (802.11x or 802.16) VVoIP endpoints.

Per other requirements, the network configuration information and settings on a VoIP instrument must be protected by a password or PIN. VVoIP endpoints do not typically provide automated PIN/password management. PINs that are not managed or required to be changed are most likely never changed, therefore they are easily compromised or guessed. Additionally as SA personnel change, the group passwords and PINs they know and use must be changed. As such, the organization must have and follow a policy and procedure for managing the passwords or PINs used to access the local VoIP phone network configurations. Such a SOP should address password/PIN complexity (length and character mix), expiration, change intervals, other conditions requiring a change, reuse, protection and storage. NOTE: Most instruments will only accept numerical input therefore a PIN is used. Some instruments may accept alpha characters for passwords. These factors help determine the password/PIN complexity that is achievable.

This makes it difficult for someone to add unauthorized digital instruments to the system. This, however, could be done easier with older analog systems by tapping an existing analog line. With VoIP, this is no longer the case. Most IPT/VoIP systems employ an automatic means of detecting and registering a new instrument on the network with the call management server and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. This presents a vulnerability whereby unauthorized instruments could be added to the system or instruments could be moved without authorization. Such activity can happen anywhere there is an active network port or outlet. This is not only a configuration management problem, but it could also allow theft of services or some other malicious attack. It is recognized however, that auto-registration is necessary during large deployments of VoIP terminals, as well as a short time thereafter, to facilitate additions and troubleshooting. This applies to initial system setup and to any subsequent large redeployments or additions. Normal, day to day, “moves, adds, and changes” will require manual registration. Since, it may be possible for an unauthorized VoIP terminal to easily be added to the system during auto-registration, the registration logs must be compared to the authorized terminal inventory. Alternately the system could have a method of automatically registering only pre-authorized terminals. This feature would support VoIP terminals that are DAA approved for connection from multiple local or remote locations. It is critical to the security of the system that all IPT /VoIP end instruments be authorized to connect to and use the system. Only authorized instruments should be configured in the system controller and therefore allowed to operate. Unauthorized instruments could lead to system compromise or abuse. A manual inventory of authorized end instruments will aid in the detection of unauthorized instruments registered to the system particularly during the period when auto-detection/registration is permitted. This will also aid in C&amp;A efforts. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Unauthorized use or abuse of the system&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20141r1_fix">Ensure that an inventory of authorized instruments is documented and maintained.

This is most easily and safely accomplished by providing a DHCP server that is dedicated to the VVoIP system endpoints. That is to say that a DHCP server serving VVoIP devices needs to be in the VVoIP domain i.e., same address space and VLAN(s). This alleviates the need to route DHCP requests into the data environment on the LAN which would degrade the separation of the VVoIP environment and the Data environment. 

NOTE: In the event a dedicated DHCP server for VVoIP endpoints is not implemented, the network (i.e., the router controlling access to and from the VVoIP endpoint VLANs) must route VVoIP endpoint DHCP requests directly to the DHCP server in such a manner that prevents traffic to flow between the VVoIP and data VLANs. Additionally the DHCP server must prevent such traffic flows while providing the VVoIP endpoints with proper VVoIP addresses and other information within the VVoIP address/subnet range (scope).

NOTE: The best practice for endpoint address assignment is to manually assign addresses when authorizing the instrument by generating its configuration file.

NOTE: This is applicable to the following: &gt; A classified LAN connected to a classified WAN (such as the SIPRNet). 

NOTE: In the case of a classified WAN where network wide address based accountability or traceability is required by the network PMO, the PMO must provide a segregated, network wide address block(s) so that the attached classified LANs can meet this requirement. DISA provides a world wide VoIP based voice communications service called the DISN Voice over Secret IP (VoSIP) service or just VoSIP for short. This service is managed by the DRSN PMO. This service also provides gateways into the DRSN. In support of the above requirement, the SIPRNet PMO has designated specific dedicated address ranges for use by the DISN VoSIP service and assigned these address blocks to the DRSN/VoSIP PMO for VoSIP address management and assignment. The VoSIP service provides VoIP based communications between VoIP systems within customer’s classified LANs (C-LANs) operating at the secret level while using the SIPRNet WAN for the inter-enclave (inter-LAN) transport. Additionally, the SIPRNet PMO requires network wide address based accountability or traceability based on assigned IP address. As such customer’s SIPRNet connected secret C-LANs utilize addresses assigned by the SIPRNet PMO. Therefore, customers of the DISN VoSIP service must use IP addresses assigned to them by the DRSN/VoSIP PMO when addressing the VoIP controllers and endpoints within their C-LANs. This is to maintain the segregation of the Voice and data environments on the customer’s secret C-LANs as required by this STIG. This also facilitates proper routing and flow control over the traffic between VoSIP addresses. 

NOTE: the DISN service is designated DISN Voice over Secret IP but uses an acronym (VoSIP) which also means Voice over Secure IP. Voice over Secure IP relates to any VoIP based service on a secure or classified IP network. 

NOTE: While the DISN VoSIP service is the preferred means to interconnect SIPRNet connected secret C-LANs for VoIP service, it is recognized that there may be a need for an organization to implement a VoIP based voice or video communications system within their organization or with close partners. In the event such a system has no need or potential need to communicate with other enclaves that use the DISN VoSIP service, they must utilize their own dedicated IP address space carved out of the address space assigned to their C-LANs by the SIPRNet PMO in accordance with the previously noted requirement.

This port is typically called a “PC Port”. This is done so that a can share a single network cable drop and LAN access switchport. The PC port can, in general, support any device requiring an Ethernet connection. In theory, a VoIP phone, a desktop VTC unit, and a workstation could be daisy chained on a single LAN drop. These PC ports are supported by an embedded three port Ethernet switch or a hub. Hubs cannot support VLANs and therefore cannot be used to daisy chain VVoIP endpoints and non VVoIP devices in DoD networks. A switch must be used because the VVoIP or VTC endpoint must be capable of maintaining the separation of the voice (VVoIP), data, VLANs as well as the VTC VLAN and PC Comm Client VLAN if present. For example the attached PC must not be able to directly access the phone’s or VTU’s configurations or communications traffic. VAN separation helps to prevent this. NOTE: the switch or endpoint will typically utilize 802.1Q trunking (VLAN tagging) but may use some other means to separate voice and data traffic.

As a refresher, the VLAN/subnets are defined as follows: &gt; Hardware Endpoints: multiple VLAN/subnets generally in parallel with data LAN VLANs the number of which is dependant on the size of the LAN and as required for the reduction of broadcast domains per good LAN design. For small networks there will be a minimum of one. &gt; Software endpoints on workstations: multiples as with hardware endpoints. &gt; VVoIP system core control equipment containing the LSC, endpoint configuration server, and DHCP server if used, etc &gt; VVoIP system management VLAN which is separate from the general LAN management VLAN &gt; Media gateways to the DSN and PSTN &gt; Signaling gateways (SG) to the DSN &gt; DoD WAN access VVoIP firewall (EBC)  &gt; Voicemail / Unified Messaging Servers. These may need to be accessible from both the voice and data VLANs. &gt; UC servers such as those supporting IM/presence, “web” browser based conferencing, and directory services. These may need to be accessible from both the voice and data VLANs. NOTE: The VLAN/subnets and associated ACLs need only to be assigned / applied for devices that exist in the VVoIP system. The VLAN / ACL design may change depending upon the location and physical makeup of the VVoIP core equipment. An example of this is if a MG and SG reside on the same platform and both use the same Ethernet LAN connection(s) (and potentially the same or different IP address(s)), then separate VLANs are not needed for the MG and SG but the ACL protecting them may need to be adjusted accordingly. In general the defined ACLs are designed in a deny-by-default manner such that only the protocols and traffic that needs to reach the device or devices in the VLAN receive the packets. The ACLs filter on VLAN, IP address / subnet, protocol type, and associated standard IP port for the protocol. In general the ACLs mentioned are egress filters (referenced the router core) on the VLAN interfaces. Additionally, the routing devices should log and alarm on inappropriate traffic. An example of this is an HTTP request sourced from the data VLAN(s) to the endpoint or media gateway VLAN(s). The primary purpose of ACL on all VVoIP VLAN interface(s) is to block traffic to/from the data VLAN interface(s). Similar restrictions are placed on a dedicated VTC VLAN interface, however, VVoIP media and signaling is permitted in the event a VTC unit needs to communicate with the UC system The “Procedure Guide: defines a nominal design for the ACLs for each VLAN interface.

The typical firewall used to protect an enclave that supports normal data traffic is not capable of properly handling or supporting real time communications (VVoIP). The following paragraphs will demonstrate this. VVoIP uses a signaling protocol and a media transfer protocol that require both inbound and outbound permissions be set for these protocols in order to provide the capability to place and receive calls to/from endpoints outside the enclave. More specifically, the signaling protocol typically uses one or more static TCP ports that must be open inbound at all times to receive calls. The media protocol; Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP) and its companion protocol Real-time Transfer Control Protocol (RTCP) utilize randomly assigned UDP ports in the potential range of 1025-65535 with four IP ports required for every bi-directional voice session/call. The number of ports is expanded if video is added. The typical method of supporting VoIP through a standard data firewall is to open (or permit inbound) the signaling IP port(s) and a wide range of UDP ports for the RTP/RTCP media streams. While a typical data firewall can provide some protection from a VoIP implementation if the inbound permit statements are limited to specific limited address ranges (applicable in some situations), this is not possible if calls are to be permitted from any IP address on the Internet or NIPRNet that could be located anywhere in the world. Address segregation for VVoIP is generally not possible since the NIPRNet address space is disjointed (chopped up) and is spread across the overall public Internet (IPv4) address space. To support a worldwide IP enabled DSN, a typical data firewall would need to permit VVoIP signaling and media inbound from the entire registered IPv4 address space. One reason why this is the case is that an ACL developed to limit inbound enclave access to permit only NIPRNet addresses would require many permit statements such that the ACL itself could degrade firewall or router performance. As such, permitting VVoIP traffic across a standard data firewall opens gaping holes in the enclave’s perimeter protection. This is of particular concern when the WAN is the Internet or a DISN service that provides connection to the INTERNET such as the NIPRNet. On the other hand, a standard data firewall poses problems for VVoIP call/session completion if external public addressing is used with internal private (RFC 1918) addressing which requires the firewall to do NAT/NAPT. This is because the VVoIP endpoints need to know the IP address of the other endpoint and they signal their address within the signaling messages. The firewall changes the IP address of the packet during the NAT but does not change it in the signaling message causing a mismatch. The effect is that the call/session cannot be completed. NOTE: If the WAN is a “closed” system where the entire address space of the WAN and connected enclaves is managed by a “single system manager” (as is the case with DISN classified networks) a specific limited and segregated address space can be assigned for all VVoIP devices for use across the entire network. In this case, the risk to the enclave can be limited (although not eliminated) if a standard firewall is used with inbound permit statements that are based on the segregated IP address range. This protection can be further enhanced by limiting the UDP port range. An allowance has been made for such a situation; however, this may change in the future. Based on the above, If VVoIP is to traverse the enclave boundary; the firewall must be VVoIP aware or capable. A VVoIP aware/capable firewall provides the following minimal functions. &gt; Interprets and understands the signaling protocol to determine the UDP ports that are negotiated for the RTP/RTCP media streams. &gt; Dynamically opens the required UDP ports to permit the flow of the media (audio and video). &gt; Performs stateful inspection on the UDP media packets to ensure the packets are part of the active call/session, while dropping all non session packets. &gt; Closes the UDP ports when the end of the call/session is signaled OR after a period of session inactivity. In the event NAT is used across the enclave boundary, the VVoIP aware/capable firewall provides the following NAT functions: &gt; Interprets and understands the signaling protocol to determine the IP addresses that are negotiated between the endpoints and adjusts the signaling messages in accordance with the local NAT/NAPT internal and external addresses. &gt; Performs the NAT/NAPT address changes on the RTP/RTCP media packets as they traverse the boundary. In the event, the VVoIP enclave boundary provides access to and interoperability with a DISN IP based assured service voice service (such as the IP-DSN on NIPRNet), VVoIP aware/capable firewall must provide the following additional functions (Note: these are defined in the UCR): &gt; Provides encryption services for the signaling protocol (AS-SIP uses TLS) &gt; Provides authentication of the source of the signaling protocol packets and drops all unauthenticated packets. &gt; Provides integrity validation of the signaling protocol packets and drops all invalid or modified packets. &gt; Terminates the AS-SIP signaling session and checks the validity of the AS-SIP messages based on content and establishes a new signaling session for the next hop, thus performing an application level inspection of the signaling messages. &gt; Communicates with Call controllers (LSCs and MFSSs) using AS-SIP/TLS &gt; Interprets and understands the AS-SIP signaling protocol to provide the minimal and NAT functions noted above &gt; Supports encrypted RTP/RTSP media streams. That is SRTP/SRTCP &gt; Provides the capability to decrypt the media streams for inspection and recording. This supports monitoring/recording for CALEA and COMSEC monitoring purposes for calls that traverse the enclave boundary. &gt; Performs intrusion and DoS detection with alarm capability for both the signaling and media. &gt; Blocks all non VVoIP traffic whether destined for the VVoIP or data sub-enclaves. NOTE: While RTCP messages could be validated for content and format, the contents of RTP packets cannot due to the random nature of the audio and video data being transmitted. Delaying the RTCP packets for inspection or the SRTCP messages for decryption and inspection while passing the RTP/SRTP packets would cause disruption in the media flow and thereby negatively affect its quality. Additionally, the delay of the SRTP packets for decryption and inspection would have similar effects. Thus intrusion detection based on the media streams is almost impossible since attack profiles are generally unavailable. Based on this and to improve worldwide voice quality, the DSN/RTS PMO and the RTS WG has determined that the SRTP/SRTCP streams will be passed by the VVoIP firewall without inspecting the encrypted contents of the packets. NOTE: The VVoIP aware/capable firewall discussed here defines a set of functions that are unique to a VVoIP which are different from the set of functions required for data firewalls. The functions for data firewalls are defined in the Network Infrastructure STIG. While typically a single firewall will not be capable of supporting both sets of functions (which means a separate VVoIP firewall is needed in parallel to the data firewall) this requirement does not mean that a dedicated VVoIP firewall must be implemented in the event a single firewall is capable of implementing both sets of functions simultaneously. The primary task of the data firewall function is to protect the entire enclave. In doing so, it must perform its normal function of protecting the data sub-enclave while also blocking all VVoIP traffic destined for it via the data firewall. An exception could be made for this on a case by case basis if permissions are limited in scope as would be the case for VTC. All data traffic/protocols destined for the VVoIP sub-enclave must also be blocked unless specifically authorized to meet a mission need. Such a mission need might be for remote management of the VVoIP system from a NOC or user-to-site VPN, however, this traffic must would be routed to the VVoIP management VLAN(s) and not the VVoIP production VLANs. An additional consideration for passing VoIP across an enclave boundary is when there are different vendor’s VoIP systems deployed within the different enclaves connected to the WAN, and the various vendor’s systems are not interoperable or do not provide assured service outside the enclave, or the WAN cannot support QoS and assured service. In this case, interoperability and assured service must be preserved across the DSN or DISN voice network, whether traditional TDM or VoIP. Therefore, the VoIP system must connect to other enclaves via a traditional TDM based long haul network. Such a connection is made using a media gateway. Therefore, if the enclave VoIP system is not compatible with the IP enabled DSN as defined in the UCR thereby providing interoperability and assured service end-to-end across the DISN voice network, the system must employ a media gateway and connect to a traditional DSN switch. Additionally, unless specific requirements (discussed later) are met, all connections to the PSTN must be via a media gateway and an appropriate trunk (PRI or CAS). &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;NONE&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;The enclave boundary protection is bypassed or degraded permitting unauthorized access to the LAN / Enclave.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;EBBD-1, EBBD-2, EBBD-3, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20286r1_fix">In the event a VVoIP/UC system is deployed/implemented within the enclave AND the enclave accesses external networks, ensure the enclave’s connection to external networks is designed to maintain the required enclave boundary protection for both the data and voice/video sub-enclaves as well as separation within the LAN and to support interoperability between different vendor’s VVoIP/UC systems implemented in different enclaves.

The network IDS inspects all NON-VVoIP traffic to/from the VVoIP management VLANs that is specifically required for management of the VVoIP system. (Except if there is an alternate data perimeter implemented for this purpose). 

&gt; The VVoIP firewall function provides protection for the VVoIP sub-enclave and the data sub-enclave as follows:

NOTE: A good indication is whether or not the VVoIP firewall is listed on the DoD UC APL found at http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/apl/index.html.

&gt; In the event the VVoIP firewall function does not exist or does not meet the requirements above, OR the locally implemented vendor’s VVoIP system does not directly interoperate with other vendor’s VVoIP systems AND the VVoIP system is connected to the DSN; the connection to the DSN is via a media gateway and an appropriate trunk that supports DSN assured service (a T619A trunk) NOTE: this is covered under another requirement.

&gt; In the event the VVoIP system is connected to the PSTN; the connection is via a media gateway and a BRI/PRI or CAS trunk (or, for small sites, DS-0s or there is an alternate phone system).  

NOTE: A PSTN media gateway connection may not be required if the site is approved for a commercial VoIP service connection. Concerns for this possibility will be addressed in subsequent requirements.

These  reasons are as follows: 
&gt; VVoIP has the potential to significantly degrade the standard data enclave boundary protection afforded by the required data enclave firewall unless the firewall is designed to properly handle VVoIP traffic. Based on this degradation,  VVoIP must not traverse a standard data firewall except under certain circumstances. 
&gt; VVoIP aware/capable firewalls are being developed and few are deployed. 
&gt; DoD must purchase and use VVoIP/UC devices and firewalls that meet UC requirements as defined in the UCR. 
&gt; Confidentiality and integrity: Legacy (early) VoIP systems could not encrypt VoIP signaling or media to protect it for confidentiality and from various attacks while traversing a publicly accessible WAN (e.g., NIPRNet or Internet). This is changing due to the DoD’s efforts to develop interoperable VVoIP encryption standards with vendor assistance. The use of a MG eliminates the need for encryption on an IP WAN by placing the voice traffic on a traditional TDM network where the communications are more secure in general even though they are not encrypted. Physical access to the wire or TDM switch is required to compromise TDM communication whereas compromise could be effected from anywhere on an IP network. 
&gt; Availability and C2 support between sites via interoperability: VoIP systems from different vendors are typically not directly interoperable via IP. This  is primarily due to the lack of fully defined standards leaving vendors to develop their own extensions to the available protocols in support of unique feature sets. This is changing due to the DoD’s efforts to develop interoperable usage of the standards with vendor assistance. The use of a MG converts each vendor’s implementation to a common interoperable system, the TDM DSN.

Determine if the VVoIP system within the site enclave is connected to a DSN EO or MFS via a local (on site) Media Gateway (MG) and one or more T619A trunks for C2 enclaves (provides MLPP support) or one or more PRI or CAS trunks for  NON-C2 enclaves with a IP-PBX-2 (NO MLPP support).

Additionally, determine if the following exceptions apply:
• Is the VVoIP system within the site enclave approved for DISN NIPRNet IP Voice Services (VS) (IP enabled DSN VoIP on NIPRNet)? 
• Is the VVoIP system within the site enclave subtended to a larger enclave and tethered (connected) to it via a direct cable, or a dedicated TDM or optical circuit (e.g., a T1, DS2, OCx )? (This connection is typical of a GSU located in relative close proximity to its MOB. This would be similar to a MAN.)
• Is the enclave part of an organizational Intranet whose enclaves (MOBs and GSUs and regional service centers or server farms) are interconnected across the DISN using dedicated TDM or optical circuits or encrypted VPN tunnels, whether site-to-site or meshed?  

This is a finding in the event the site is not connected to the DSN via a MG located at the local site enclave as described above AND one of the exceptions is not applicable. 

NOTE: This requirement dictates that each site’s VoIP enclave has a local (on site) MG for connecting the site locally to a DSN EO or MFS. The DSN EO or MFS may be located at a remote site, in which case the TDM trunks will carry the voice traffic between the sites. This arrangement means that VoIP traffic does not have to traverse the enclave boundary with the WAN which is one of the reasons for the requirement.

As such they are considered mission critical and we have become accustomed to their high reliability and availability which is generally on the order of 5 nines. 

Many VVoIP systems are based on general-purpose operating systems such as Windows, Unix, LINUX as well as database and web server applications such as MS-SQL, Oracle, IIS, Tomcat, and others. Additionally, vendors of these systems usually customize or only use portions of the general-purpose operating systems and applications. Vendors also use and potentially customize open source software (OSS).

Vulnerabilities are discovered every day in these general-purpose operating systems and applications by the community their original vendors.  The vendors of these general-purpose systems and applications (such as Microsoft and others) routinely provide patches for their products to address bugs and vulnerabilities while other vendors and the OSS community provide upgraded versions of the software. These vulnerabilities and their mitigations usually appear in the DOD’s Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process as Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs). The process mandates that these IAVAs be addressed in a specific time frame based on the severity of the issue. Many times the mandated “fix” is to apply the original vendors patch or to upgrade to the “fixed” version of the software that has the vulnerability.

Due to the mission critical nature of our voice telecommunications systems, owners and operators must be cautioned against applying patches to their systems that are provided by the original vendor of the general-purpose operating systems and applications used in their systems as these may severely and adversely affect the operability of a portion of the system or may cause the system to crash. Significant down time could result which would amount to a self imposed denial of service.

To prevent operability issues and downtime to the greatest extent possible, the VVoIP system vendor must first determine if the OEM vulnerability and mitigating patch is applicable to their system or a portion thereof, and then test the mitigation/patch to validate that it will not degrade the system or its security. The IPT / VoIP vendor may have to modify the OEM patch or produce their own patch before releasing it to their customers. Obtaining a vendor tested and vendor approved patch from the system vendor provides the greatest assurance that responding to an IAVA will not involve a negative impact on the system.

To aid in this process, VVoIP system vendor must be advised of IAVAs that may apply to their systems. This is best accomplished by asking the vendor if the CVE or OEM patch number noted in the IAVA applies to your system and version of code. If so, they probably already have a tested and approved patch available for their customers. If not they will be alerted to the fact they need to provide one or test and approve the application of the OEM mitigation.

A PC could be dedicated to a task, protected, and controlled such that it is highly available for mission critical applications and communications. However, a user’s general purpose PC or other computing device may not be highly available for mission critical communications, particularly if it is not dedicated to that task. This because it supports many applications and functions while being connected to a network through which any number of threats can come. Mission critical applications and communications are also negatively affected if the PC is powered off, busy with another process, the communications application is not loaded or running properly, or if the PC is compromised and/or is having operational problems. While a fixed desktop or tower PC may be kept in a powered on and network connected state most of the time, a portable PC (laptop) is much more likely to be powered off and disconnected from the network. There is more chance that the PC and communications application won’t work, or be available, when needed compared to a dedicated device such as purpose built hard phones or dedicated PCs. Power for operating the PCs is another consideration in our discussion of their support for assured services and mission critical systems, users, and locations. If there is no power in the user’s workspace, the PC will not function unless a backup power supply is provided. Thus may be provided using a battery based Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) or a backup generator. Either solution is very costly when providing backup power to the workspace for the PC, particularly for large numbers of users. Provisions for light and other environmental factors may also be necessary adding to cost. On the other hand, power is much more easily provided to a hardware based phone from the wiring closet using the LAN cabling. A UPS or generator will still be needed but in a centralized location reducing cost. Another factor is the robustness and reliability of the network to which the PC is connected. As noted above, DoD networks can and must be designed and controlled to provide the reliability and robustness needed to support assured service. This can work well for a dedicated communications endpoint but not necessarily for a PC communications application. This is because the PC will be connected to the portion of the LAN that carries normal data traffic by default. That is the portion of the LAN that can be compromised and degraded by various DoS attacks and other issues making it difficult for this portion of the LAN to provide assured service. The VoIP STIG defines some of the LAN requirements for the support of assured service, most notably the separation of the voice assets and traffic on the LAN from the data assets and traffic while maintaining a converged LAN architecture. Various solutions may also be available that can allow a PC to mitigate or manage these issues. These will be discussed later in the LAN use case section of this STIG. 

A remotely connected PC cannot be relied upon to support assured service if it is connected to a non-DoD network such as an Internet connected LAN or the internet itself. This is due to lack of DoD control over the network to which it is attached. While most non-DoD LANs and the Internet are relatively reliable and may be robust regarding bandwidth, there is no control over the conditions in, or the availability of, these networks, whether it is the LAN or WAN. Based on the factors noted in the previous paragraphs, PCs cannot provide the reliability and availability required for assured service when compared to the reliability and availability specifications for a LAN supporting assured service. These factors make it difficult to consider a user’s general purpose fixed, or portable, PC as being a stable platform for mission critical communications in an assured service sense, even though that is desired. All of these factors also affect non-assured service systems that provide life safety and emergency communications. In the future, PC and PC based communications application vendors may solve these problems and provide us with fully assured service capable PC based communications on a standard general purpose, general use platform at a reasonable cost. These issues do not, however, preclude a PC based communications application from attempting to place and receive priority communications sessions. A C2 user may use this type of end instrument for the origination of, or reception of routine and non-routine calls at their discretion, as long as a purpose built instrument or other backup communications system/device is also available for use as a backup communications method when necessary. This however, may not be feasible in all situations such as when using a portable PC outside of the normal workspace.

Note: Voice communications is the most critical communications service for C2 users. While VTC and collaboration is an important C2 tool, a telephone call is the minimal method needed to give and receive orders. Since a PC based application may not be available at all times, backup voice communications methods are needed. This could be accomplished in several ways. Minimally, in the normal workspace, there needs to be a hardware based telephone, either IP or otherwise, connected to a different portion of the network than the PC. While a hardware based IP phone could be associated with the PC, if the portion of the network serving the PC was the cause of the PC being inoperable for C2 communications, the phone might also not be available or operational.

This would be approximately equal to that achieved using an ASLAN and purpose built hardware based endpoints. 

Applicability of this requirement can vary based on the specific use case and situation. For example, this is “not applicable” in the event a C2 user is in a situation where there is no need to place or receive priority calls.

NOTE: While covering such information mitigates disclosure when a camera is to be used, if the camera is activated unexpectedly or without taking action to cover the information prior to activating, the information can be compromised. The best practice is to not display it in view of the camera at all.

NOTE: Vulnerability awareness and operational training will be provided to users of video/collaboration communications related camera(s) regarding these requirements.

NOTE: This requirement is relevant no matter what the classification level of the session. In an IP environment the classification of PC communications is dependent upon the classification of the network to which the PC is attached, and the classification of the facility in which it is located. While classified communications can occur at the same level of classification as the network and facility, communications having a lower classification or no classification (e.g., unclassified or FOUO) may also occur in the same environment. As such, sensitive or classified information that is not part of the communications session might be improperly disclosed without proper controls in place.
Inspect the applicable SOP. 

Inspect a random sampling of workspaces and conference rooms to determine compliance. Look for potentially sensitive information posted on the walls in view of the camera(s). 

Interview the IAO to determine how the SOP is enforced. Inspect user training materials and discuss practices to determine if information regarding the SOP is conveyed. Interview a random sampling of users to confirm their awareness of the SOP and related information.

This is a finding if deficiencies are found in any of these areas. Note the deficiencies in the finding details.

This same sensitivity is included in VTUs that are used in office spaces. This has one disadvantage. The microphones can pick up sidebar conversations that have no relationship to the conference or call in progress. Likewise, in an open area, received conference audio can be broadcast to others in the area that are not part of the conference, and possibly should not be exposed to the conference information for need-to-know reasons. Speakerphones exhibit a similar vulnerability. This is the same confidentiality vulnerability posed to audible sound information in the environment as discussed above with the added twist that the conference audio is vulnerable to others in the environment. While this is more of an issue in environments where classified conversations normally occur, it is also an issue in any environment. This is of particularly concern in open work areas or open offices where multiple people work in near proximity. Users or operators of VTC systems of any type must take care regarding who can hear what is being said during a conference call and what unrelated conversations can be picked up by the sensitive microphone. Where a VTU is used by a single person in an open area, a partial mitigation for this could be the use of a headset with earphones and a microphone. While this would limit the ability of others to hear audio from the conference and could also limit the audio pickup of unrelated conversations, it may not be fully effective. In some instances, such as when a VTU is located in a SCIF, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) handset/headset may be required Microphones embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint, PC, or PC monitor can be sensitive enough to pick up sound that is not related to a given communications session. They could pick up nearby conversations and other sounds. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is not related to the communications in progress. Speakers embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint or PC can be made loud enough to be heard across a room or in the next workspace. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is being communicated during a session. Users must be aware of other conversations in the area and their sensitivity when using any communications endpoint, not only a PC based voice, video, or collaboration communications application. This awareness must then translate into protecting or eliminating these other conversations. A short range, reduced gain, or noise canceling microphone may be required. A push to talk microphone may also be required for classified areas. The microphone should be muted when the user is not speaking as both mitigation for this issue, and for proper etiquette when participating in a conference. The muting function should be performed using a positively controlled disconnect, shorting switch, or mechanism instead of a software controlled mute function on the PC. Users must be aware of other people in the area that could hear what is being communicated. This is particularly an issue if the communicated information is sensitive or classified since the parties overhearing the information may not have proper clearance or a need-to-know. To mitigate this issue, a headset or speakers should be used and at a volume that only the user can hear.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECND-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-16180r2_fix">Ensure a policy and procedure is in place and enforced that addresses the placement and operation of hardware based voice and video communications devices and PC based voice, video, UC, and collaboration communications applications with regard to their audio pickup and broadcast capabilities in relation to the sensitivity of the information communicated.

While the technology for doing this is different between hardware based VTC endpoints and PC based application endpoints, the vulnerability is the same. In both cases, the displayed information typically resides on a PC. While in presentation/sharing mode, care must be exercised so that the PC user does not inadvertently display and transmit information on their workstation which is not part of the communications session and not intended to be viewed by the other communicating parties. Users must be aware that anything they display on their PC monitor while presenting to a communications session may be displayed on the other communicating endpoints. This is particularly true when the PC video output is connected to a VTC CODEC since the information will be displayed on all of the conference monitors. This presentation/sharing feature could result in the disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals that do not have a validated need-to-know or have the proper clearance to view the information. Thus the presentation/sharing feature presents a vulnerability to other information displayed on the PC if the feature is misused. This is a problem when sharing (displaying) a PC desktop via any collaboration tool using any connection method. There is little that can be done to mitigate this vulnerability other than to develop policy and procedures to present to collaborative communications sessions. All users which perform this function must have awareness of the issues and be trained in the proper operational procedures. Such procedures may require that there be no non-session related documents or windows open or minimized on the PC while presenting or sharing. An additional requirement may be that the user may not permit others in a session to remotely control their PC. A SOP is needed that addresses mitigations for the vulnerabilities posed by PC data and presentation sharing. Such an SOP could include the following discussion. If a user needs to view non meeting related information while presenting to a conference, the PC external display port must be turned off or better yet, the cable disconnected. Dual monitor operation of the PC could mitigate this problem somewhat. The second monitor output would be connected to the CODEC which would serve as the second monitor.

If this was to occur, there could be inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or classified information to individuals without the proper clearance or need-to-know. This vulnerability could occur if the endpoint was set to automatically answer a voice, VTC, or collaboration call with audio and video capabilities enabled, or if the endpoint was compromised and remotely controlled. The stated requirements and mitigations involve muting the microphone(s) and disabling or covering the camera(s).

These or similar vulnerabilities could exist in PC based communications/collaboration applications due to an auto answer feature or compromised application or platform. As such, the simplest mitigation would be to only operate the software that accesses the microphone and camera when they are needed for communication. This does not work well for a unified communications application that is used to enhance our communications/collaboration capabilities since the application would be running most, if not all of the time when the PC is operating. In this case, the microphone could be muted and camera disabled in software as a mitigation. However, this also may not work well due to the possibility of the communications/collaboration application, microphone, or camera could be remotely activated if the platform or a communications application is compromised.  In this case positive physical controls may be required. We must also rely on our defense in depth strategy for protecting our PC applications, including our communications applications, from compromise. 

Physical disablement such as unplugging from the PC, using a physical mute switch, or covering a camera could work if using external devices. However, this mitigation would not work for embedded microphones and cameras as is the trend in laptops and monitors today. While it may not be easily feasible to physically disable an embedded microphone, the lens of an embedded camera can be covered.

Our discussion here relates to, UC soft client specific accessories, which include USB phones, USB ATAs, PPGs, and headsets. A USB phone is a physical USB connected telephone instrument that associates itself with the UC soft client application running on the PC. It minimally provides a handset which includes both the mouthpiece and receiver and may provide a dial pad, a speakerphone function, or other functions. A USB ATA is a USB connected device that associates itself with the UC soft client application and provides the ability to utilize a standard analog telephone or speakerphone. Some USB ATAs also provide a port to which an analog phone line can be connected. This allows a single analog phone to be used with the UC soft client while also answering and placing calls via the analog phone line. This line could be connected to a local PBX or to the PSTN. Some USB phones contain a port to which an analog phone line can be connected so the USB phone can be used with it to place and receive calls. There is little risk in the operation of this kind of USB ATA or USB phone providing it operates only as described and there is no direct bridging of networks as described next. A PPG (USB connected or internal card) is a type of ATA that is a gateway intended to bridge the UC soft client application and supporting VVoIP network to an analog phone line from a local PBX or the PSTN. PPGs pose legal and fraud threats to a DoD network due to this bridging of networks. PPGs can be used for toll fraud, toll avoidance, or placing or receiving unauthorized calls. Some USB Phones contain a PPG. While these devices might be used to meet a specific mission requirement, their use may be illegal in certain countries and instances when connected between a DoD IP voice and data network and a public dial-up voice network.

These have been discussed previously and are not included in the topic of this section. A USB phone is a physical USB connected telephone instrument that associates itself with the UC soft client application running on the PC. It minimally provides a handset which includes both the mouthpiece and receiver and may provide a dial pad, a speakerphone function, or other functions. 
A USB ATA is a USB connected device that associates itself with the UC soft client application and provides the ability to utilize a standard analog telephone or speakerphone. Some USB ATAs also provide a port to which an analog phone line can be connected. This allows a single analog phone to be used with the UC soft client while also answering and placing calls via the analog phone line. This line could be connected to a local PBX or to the PSTN. Some USB phones contain a port to which an analog phone line can be connected so the USB phone can be used with it to place and receive calls. There is little risk in the operation of this kind of USB ATA or USB phone providing it operates only as described and there is no direct bridging of networks as described next. A PPG (USB connected or internal card) is a type of ATA that is a gateway intended to bridge the UC soft client application and supporting VVoIP network to an analog phone line from a local PBX or the PSTN. PPGs pose legal and fraud threats to a DoD network due to this bridging of networks. They can be used for toll fraud, toll avoidance, or placing or receiving unauthorized calls. Some USB Phones can contain a PPG. While these devices might be used to meet a specific mission requirement, their use may be illegal in certain countries and instances when connected between a DoD IP voice and data network and a public dial-up voice network.

While this degrades the protections afforded a hardware based system, the trend is to use more and more PC based communications applications due to their advanced features, collaborative benefits, and perceived reduced cost. This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware based telephones on user’s desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service since the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. This also means that there will be no telephone available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, or the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. NOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware based instrument in the user’s workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user work space as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. The following is a list of some of these: • The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time. Users may not even have a means to report the failure without using an alternate communications system. A fast spreading worm or power outage could create such a situation. While some may argue that “users can call on their cell phones”, service may not be available or their use may not be permitted in the facility. This translates into the following: - The loss of functionality and efficiency as in lost time due to the inability to communicate when the PC or soft-phone application is not running or functioning properly. • The protections afforded hardware based endpoints by the use of the voice protection zone such as VoIP VLAN(s), and others are missing for soft-phones in a widespread use/implementation scenario and, depending on the implementation on the PC, may degrade the protections afforded hardware based endpoints. Such is the case for all software based communications endpoints since they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs. Assured service for voice traffic will be degraded from that obtained with hardware based instruments connected in the voice protection zone. This translates into the following additional IA measures required to protect the VoIP infrastructure (e.g., a firewall between the VoIP and data VLANs). • The hardware based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging onto the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has C2 responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. • Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a “soft-phone world” is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace which is an additional cost. This additional distance however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application not functioning properly, they may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending upon the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or law suites for this eventuality. • The previous 2 items translate into the following: - The addition of common use hardware based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency usage) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may feel that this is not an IA issue, in reality it is since the discussion is truly about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. Additionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware based instruments. NOTE: Methods for permitting the necessary PC traffic to, from, and between the voice and data zones while protecting the voice zone will be discussed later in this document.

This means that there is a validated mission need and the number of UC soft clients permitted to operate inside the LAN will be less than the number of hardware based phones in the LAN. This number should be limited to those UC soft clients required to meet specific mission requirements. There are scenarios for the use of limited numbers of UC soft clients in the strategic LAN. The first of these scenarios is providing support for UC soft clients associated with a VoIP system in another enclave. This is a remote access scenario and must operate as they would in a normal remote access use case. If this scenario is approved, special accommodations must be made in the local LAN to support users from a remote LAN and permit them to connect to their home enclave. This could include segregating them on a separate dedicated LAN with its own boundary protection or by implementing a dedicated VLAN protection zone while opening the enclave boundary to permit the remote connection. 

Voice/video and data must reside on separate VLANs for the protection of the voice infrastructure. However, recognizing that requiring a NIC to be configured to support voice/video and data VLANs is not a viable solution, voice and data traffic can coexist in the data VLAN when leaving the workstation. Based on the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) requirement that the Unified Capabilities (UC) application tag its signaling and media traffic with the proper UCR defined Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP), the LAN access switch port can route the UC traffic to the voice/video VLAN. If the LAN access switch is not capable, then routing upstream must perform this. A separate NIC is not required to support VLANs for voice and video segmentation under UC.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Designated Approving Authority&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-16201r2_fix">Ensure the responsible AO approves the use of UC soft clients in the strategic LAN along with the measures implemented to protect UC soft clients and the local VoIP and data infrastructure.

When limited numbers of UC soft clients associated with the local VoIP system are implemented in the strategic LAN, a separate VLAN structure must be implemented for them. Implementation of a VLAN must not provide a bridge between the VoIP and data VLANs. Traffic must be filtered such that the UC soft client’s VoIP traffic is routed to the VoIP VLAN while all other traffic is routed to the data VLAN. A separate NIC is not required to support VLANs for voice and video segmentation under UC.

NOTE: Limited numbers in this scenario means as few as possible, but may mean 25 or 30 percent of the overall PCs on the LAN. Beyond this percentage, the protections afforded by this implementation become limited or negated because of the large number of PCs in the UC soft client VLAN.

Traditional computer telephony integration CTI encompasses the control of a telephone or telecommunications switch by a computer application. Interfaces have been developed to provide connection between the computer, typically a workstation, and the telephone or other terminal attached to the telephone switch, and possibly a special analog or TDM line going directly to the telephone switch. Applications are also developed to make use of these interfaces to integrate a data application with the telephone system. Sometimes the integration is as simple as being able to dial a number from the computer application or it could provide full control of the switch as in the case of an operator’s console. In these traditional scenarios, the voice stayed in a traditional telephone set and the data stayed on the computer with the exception of the control information. If the voice does enter the computer, it is sent directly to the sound card or converted to a sound file for storage and possible file transfer. The voice communication is not transmitted in real time via IP protocols. In contrast, modern day CTI is changing in that today the voice communications and control is being transmitted using IP protocols and the hardware interfaces and telephones are being replaced by computer applications. 

NOTE: the CTI systems discussed here are not unified communications applications although some of the features are similar. CTI systems generally have a special function and are not a general user application. These are typically Call Center or Help Desk applications. This type of CTI typically involves integration with a database application. In this scenario, where soft-phones are an integral part of the CTI system/application, implementation of separate voice and data zones could be detrimental to the proper functioning of the application. While separation requirements should be enforced if possible, they could be relaxed providing the general CTI requirement of treating the CTI system as an enclave is followed. A system such as this should have its own VoIP controller. If the system needs to communicate with systems outside the CTI system enclave, proper boundary protection must be provided. For example, since IP soft-phones are prevalent in today’s call center / helpdesk systems, such a system would require the ability to place and receive phone calls from outside the CTI enclave. Calls might leave and enter the enclave via VoIP or a TDM media gateway. The workstations and call center agents may also need to email and access the web.

These measures are designed to protect the VVoIP service and infrastructure to the greatest extent possible in the event there is a compromise of an OS or application on a workstation or server attached to the data side of the LAN. If this occurs, the compromised platform could be used by an adversary to compromise the VVoIP communications or its supporting infrastructure. Such compromise can happen rather easily, particularly when a server is a web or application server or a workstation is used for web surfing or email. A secondary reason for the implementation of the LAN architecture and security measures defined is to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of the supported VVoIP communications. Based on these two reasons, the defined VVoIP architecture serves to segregate and hide the VVoIP communications and infrastructure (to the greatest extent possible on a converged LAN) from the data workstation users and associated platforms. While VVoIP systems deployed on a strategic B/C/P/S provide a combination of general business or administrative communications along with C2 communications, tactical deployments primarily support C2 communications. There is nowhere other than a tactical deployment that the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of a VVoIP communications service is as critical. Therefore the network supporting a tactical VVoIP communications system must follow the same guidelines as a network supporting a strategic VVoIP system or application. 

NOTE: Initial deployments may include as little as a half dozen workstations or as many as fifty. Once the initial deployment is in place, the network may grow and become relatively permanent as would be the case for a rear command or logistics center. 
NOTE: A shipboard LAN is minimally considered as a fixed tactical LAN but can also be considered as a Strategic LAN. This is because the installation is permanent within the confines of the mobile floating base. In other words, the base (AKA ship) moves without disrupting the LAN.

If the fixed tactical network supports IP based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications, determine if it is configured per the requirements for a strategic LAN.

This is a finding in the event the deployed tactical network is relatively permanent compared to a small highly mobile unit and the LAN is not configured as a strategic LAN for the support of supports IP based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications as defined in this and other STIGs.

NOTE: The factors determining whether a deployed tactical VVoIP system is subject to this requirement are varied. In general all VVoIP systems should be configured the same and such that the service and supporting infrastructure is protected. It is recognized that a small system operated out of a transit case in a tent, conex box, or a truck is highly mobile as opposed to a fixed installation in a building. While initially such a system can support a few users and remain highly mobile, as the number of users increases, the deployment becomes semi-permanent, or fixed (not highly mobile). Initial deployments may include as little as a half dozen workstations or as many as fifty. Once the initial deployment is in place, the network may grow and become relatively permanent as would be the case for a rear command or logistics center. Small deployable packages that are designed to be initially deployed with a small footprint supporting or using PC soft-phones, which are then to be the basis of a larger network, must be configured, or be configurable, to support the separate VoIP and data zones as well as hardware based instruments and admission control for C2 communications as the deployed network and supported systems grow. The network will also include soft-phone protection zones as required in a strategic network if soft-phones are permitted to be used beyond the initial deployment. 
NOTE: A shipboard LAN is minimally considered as a fixed tactical LAN but can also be considered as a Strategic LAN. This is because the installation is permanent within the confines of the mobile floating base.

An argument could be made that a tactical LAN and attached workstations might be less prone to compromise than a strategic LAN and its attached workstations therefore we do not need all these security measures for VoIP. This argument might be supported by the smaller size of a tactical LAN, particularly an initially deployed system, mission duration, and the ability to limit its usage to tactical applications. Unfortunately if the tactical LAN is connected to NIPRNet or the strategic LAN at the home base, it can still be compromised particularly if general web browsing is permitted and performed and email is used. Additionally, there is nowhere that C2 communications is more important than in the tactical LAN. Any decision to eliminate any of the protective measures for the C2 voice service that could negatively impact its reliability must be based in a risk assessment that weighs the benefits against the risks. Deployable packages that are designed to be initially deployed with a small footprint supporting or using PC soft-phones, which are then to be the basis of a larger network, must be configured, or be configurable, to support the separate VoIP and data zones as well as hardware based instruments and admission control for C2 communications as the deployed network and supported systems grow. The network will also include soft-phone protection zones as required in a strategic network if soft-phones are permitted to be used beyond the initial deployment. In general, larger relatively permanent tactical networks should be configured the same as a strategic network since similar vulnerabilities exist. 

As a result, if IA measures are to be relaxed for a highly mobile tactical network or deployable package, the reduction must be supported by an approved benefit vs. risk analysis.

In the event voice/video/UC IA configuration measures are reduced for highly mobile tactical networks (e.g., initial deployment packages) supporting hardware or PC based voice, video, unified, and/or collaboration communications, the IAO will ensure a benefit vs. risk analysis is performed, documented, and approved in the certification and accreditation of the system.

NOTE: It is recognized that deployable packages for highly mobile tactical networks may only support PC based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications applications. Such a network may not require separate zones for voice and data since all traffic will be in the data zone.

Determine if IA configuration measures are reduced for highly mobile tactical networks (e.g., initial deployment packages) supporting hardware or PC based voice, video, UC, and/or collaboration communications. If so, inspect network diagrams and device configurations to determine the IA measures implemented. If the implemented IA measures are reduced from those required in a strategic or fixed tactical LAN, inspect the documented benefit vs. risk analysis used in the C&amp;A process for the system.

This is a finding if there is no benefit vs. risk analysis, or it is found to be deficient in some manner, such that the appropriate risk level was not used in the C&amp;A of the system.

App. DoD APL Certificatio</title><description>&lt;GroupDescription&gt;&lt;/GroupDescription&gt;</description><Rule id="SV-17097r1_rule" severity="medium" weight="10.0"><version>VVoIP 1120 (GENERAL)</version><title>A PC Communications Application is not tested for IA and Interoperability and are not listed on the DoD UC APL.</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;DoDI 8100.3 provides policy for the DoD that requires the testing and certification of telecommunications systems for Interoperability and Information Assurance (IA) while establishing an Approved Products List (APL) for certified and accredited products. Under Applicability and Scope, it states “This Instruction applies to the hardware or software for sending and receiving voice, data, or video signals across a network that provides customer voice, data, or video equipment access to the DSN, DRSN or PSTN.” Additional statements in this section expand this to most devices or systems that are associated with providing telecommunications service. 

The purpose of this testing is twofold. One aspect is to determine if a vendor’s product or system meets DoD functional requirements and that it can interoperate with established or existing DoD systems. The other aspect is to determine if the system can be configured to meet DoD IA requirements and operate at an acceptable level of risk. A product must be approved under both categories before listing on the APL.  

DoD components are required to fulfill their communications needs by only purchasing APL listed products, providing one of the listed products meets their needs. This means the APL must be consulted prior to purchasing a system or product. If no listed product meets the organization’s needs, they may sponsor a product for testing that does meet their needs. 

NOTE: The APL as created by this instruction was originally called the DSN APL and covered dial-up telecommunications systems or products providing unclassified communications. It has been expanded to cover additional types of approved products and has been renamed to the Unified Capabilities APL by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) for Networks and Information Integration (NII). Additional categories have been implemented for DRSN (classified communications) related systems/products and for IPv6 capable products. The APL can be found at http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/apl/index.html. This APL is referred to as the DoD APL or UC APL. 

Tactical use cases or systems that do not provide access to the DSN, DRSN or PSTN which are private closed communications systems, may be accredited via the Information Support Plan (ISP) or Tailored Information Support Plan (TISP) process managed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Joint Staff J6I, and the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) United States (US) Military Communications Electronics Board (USMCEB) Interoperability Test Panel (ITP). 

This policy applies directly to any PC communications application that provides voice communications services to and/or from the DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN. This will most often be a soft-phone or unified communications application (with any associated accessories) that is associated with or supported by a DoD telephone system. The application may, or may not, provide additional communications services such as video, collaboration, or other unified communications services. This policy is extensible to other types of PC communications applications whose primary purpose may be VTC, IM, or collaboration, if the application or service provides interoperability with the DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN typically through a gateway, or uses these systems for transport.

Ensure PC communications applications providing voice, data, or video communications interoperability with the DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN, along with any associated accessories (e.g., USB phones, cameras, and USB ATAs), are interoperability and IA tested and placed on the Approved Products List (APL) prior to purchase, per DoDI 8100.3.

NOTE : APL listing of soft-phone applications, and/or associated accessories, will be in association with, or part of, the listed VoIP telecommunications switch/system that supports the application. Other applications (VTC or collaboration) will be listed with their core service or system.

NOTE: This is not a finding in the event a PC communications application implementation and/or supporting system is not associated with, interoperable with, or connected to DSN, DRSN/VoSIP, or PSTN and is never expected to be.

NOTE: The DRSN is a custom and proprietary non-VoIP telephone system. It interoperates, to a degree, with a Defense Information System Network (DISN) VoIP telephone system/service on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). This VoIP service is called VoSIP (see acronym discussion in the next note).  The discussion/requirement here applies to PC communications application associated with VoSIP that ultimately can interoperate with DRSN endpoints.  

NOTE: NSA defines VoSIP as Voice over Secure IP or regular (un-encrypted or encrypted) VoIP over any secure or classified IP LAN (i.e., local C-LAN) or WAN (e.g., SIPRNet or JWICS). In general, VoSIP employs encryption at Layer 1/Layer 2 applied to links between un-encrypted classified enclaves. The use of the acronym VoSIP for the DISN service and for instantiations on DoD component’s classified LANs leads to confusion between the service and the intentional meaning of the acronym. NSA defines a similar acronym, SVoIP, meaning Secure VoIP. This refers to end-to-end NSA type-1 encrypted VoIP media and possibly signaling streams that can traverse a network having a lower classification. This is similar in concept to the secure voice service provided by a STU or STE as well as SCIP based devices. SCIP works at Layer 7 (application layer) and can use Type 1 or Type 3 encryption. It is not IP specific since it was developed for traditional fixed and mobile transport methods. Type 3 encryption of VoIP signaling and media is not SCIP. Unfortunately, the SVoIP acronym/term has also been corrupted by some organizations using it to refer to their implementation of VoIP on their classified LANs and the SIPRNet WAN.

Inspect the APL testing report for the APL approved VoIP system supporting the PC communications application to determine if it was tested and approved along with the supporting communications system. 

NOTE: these applications are typically NOT listed separately on the APL. APL testing reports are available to DoD users of the product and reviewers via email from the Unified Capabilities Certification Office (UCCO) at ucco@disa.mil. It is highly recommended that requests for these reports are submitted and the report obtained before SRR trips commence. This is a finding if it is determined that the PC communications application was not tested and approved along with the supporting communications system.

The source of these applications can vary depending upon the type of application. To protect DoD interests, the source of the application depends on the criticality of the communications method. One source for compromise of a communications application is the use of freeware or shareware applications. Communications applications that provide voice communications must be designed to properly interoperate with the VoIP system. These applications should be a standard product of the voice system vendor or a partner whose product is approved by this vendor. 

Some UC soft clients provide VTC and collaboration features and should be sourced from the voice system vendor. Applications providing VTC features that interoperate directly with a hardware based VTC system should be sourced from the VTC system’s vendor or a partner whose product is approved by this vendor. Other UC soft clients that provide collaboration services while also providing voice and video communications features must also be sourced from a major vendor in the business of providing collaboration systems or services. UC soft clients that provide multiple services such as IM, presence, voice, VTC, web conferencing, and so forth, may be integrated with the operating system, such as Microsoft’s Office Communications applications. Application sourcing can also be dependent on whether the application is to interoperate with hardware based communications system located and operated within an enclave or whether it is a system operated by an interagency or inter-base program. The vendor must be able to provide patches, upgrades or both to mitigate newly discovered vulnerabilities found in their product in a timely manner. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-16217r2_fix">Ensure the UC soft clients are supported by the manufacturer or vendor.</fixtext><fix id="F-16217r2_fix" /><check system="C-17155r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_VVoIP STIG Policy.xml" /><check-content>Review the site documentation to confirm the UC soft clients are supported by the manufacturer or vendor.

While this is the norm for hardware based endpoints in a LAN, it is even more important for PC application based endpoints. Such endpoints must not accept service from just any available system. Such a system could actually be in a different organization than the one the application belongs to, depending upon how the application seeks out its controller/server. Peer-to-peer, or direct PC application-to-application communications are based on knowing the other endpoint’s IP address is not permitted. All communications applications must contact their designated session controller(s), gateway(s), or server(s) for authorization to operate. 

NOTE: This is the general rule for all communications types with the exception of point-to-point VTC sessions between hardware based VTC CODECs.

An additional consideration is the reliability of a critical voice communications service and its continuity of operations. This is a prime concern for hardware based VoIP systems which are intended or are designed to provide assured service. Such critical systems must be supported by redundant controllers.  If a soft-phone associated with such a system is to be reliable, it must be configured to interact with its primary controller(s) and at least one backup.

It controls the PPS that are permitted or approved to cross DoD network boundaries as well as mitigations for vulnerabilities inherent in the approved PPSs. Standard well known and registered IP ports and associated protocols and services are assessed for vulnerabilities and threats to the entire Global Information Grid (GIG) which includes the DISN backbone networks. The results are published in a Vulnerability Assessment (VA) report. Each port and protocol is given a rating of green, yellow, orange, or red associated with each of the 16 defined boundary types. Green means the protocol is relatively secure and is approved to cross the associated boundary without restrictions. Yellow means the protocol has issues that can be mitigated and it can be used if the required mitigations are used as noted in the VA. Red means that the protocol issues cannot be mitigated, is not secure, or approved, and in fact is banned when crossing that boundary. A new category is Orange which is the same as red except that the protocol is in use and cannot be removed from the network. It recognizes that the protocol exists on the network and is necessary but also mandates that new systems and applications must not be developed using this protocol whether it crosses a boundary or not. Some red and orange protocols have mitigations listed in their VA that must be used if the protocol is used during its remaining life. The information regarding the assessed ports and protocols and the defined boundaries is published in the PPS Assurance Categories Assignment List (CAL). See the Enclave and Network Infrastructure STIGS, the 8550.1, and the latest PPS CAL for a more complete discussion of this DoD program and policy. The PPSM information is available on the IASE and DKO/DoD IA Portal web sites. A portion of the DoDI 8550.1 PPS policy requires registration of those PPS that cross any of the boundaries defined by the policy that are “visible to DoD-managed components”. The following PPS registration requirement applies to all PPSs used by a Voice/Video/UC system to include the core infrastructure devices and its hardware based or PC application based endpoints whether or not a PPS crosses the IP based Enclave boundary to the DISN WAN or another enclave.

</title><description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Voice phone services are critical to the effective operation of a business, an office, or in support or control of a DoD mission. We rely on these services being available when they are needed. Additionally, it is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation such as a security breach or life safety event. The capability or ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. While the DoD voice and data networks are designed to be extremely reliable, such that continuity of operations (COOP) is supported, there is the potential that a site’s EIs will loose the availability to communicate or signal with the LSC or MFSS. Reality is that if signaling messages cannot reach a LSC or MFSS, calls cannot be established. This is an issue even though the LSC and MFSS are specified to provide 5 9s availability; there are many other factors that affect the availability of these central devices. Natural disasters or physical damage to the network connections and/or pathways are just some. The following are considerations for meeting this requirement: 
• Large sites and Intranets: 
•• Redundancy of platforms – Two or more LSC controllers clustered o  Geographic diversity in locating the multiple LSCs within the site or Intranet 
• Small Sites (not dual homed): 
•• A single local subtended LSC may use a LSC to which it is subtended as the backup LSC for call control in the event the local LSC goes down. The best method for meeting this requirement on a large site is to implement redundancy for the LSC and the LSC portion of a MFSS. These redundant devices would then be located in redundant and geographically diverse facilities and connected to different parts of the LAN or CAN. This would mean that two core locations would be established within the site/enclave. LSCs and the LSC portion of a MFSS may be implemented on redundant platforms to meet the 5 9s availability requirements. Potentially these internally redundant devices might be able to be decomposed and located in the redundant facilities. Additional protections are needed for the communications between these decomposed elements. Additionally, each portion of the decomposed elements would need to be able to function on its own. In the event a site/enclave supports multiple tenants and one or more of these tenants have their own LSC, the main site could establish a COOP relationship with the tenant LSC and vise versa. An alternate method might be to establish a COOP relationship to a LSC or MFSS in another site or enclave. The issue with this arrangement is that the interconnection between sites is vulnerable and should be redundant with potentially COOP relationships with multiple LSCs at multiple sites. The best method for an Intranet served by a central LSC or MFSS is to place redundant LSCs in redundant and geographically diverse facilities which are then connected to different parts of the Intranet. Sites served by these LSCs should be dual homed using redundant circuits via geographically diverse paths.

It is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability of maintaining the ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. DoD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable and provide continuity of operations (COOP) support. However, the potential exists that a site may become severed from the DoD network. Some site’s DoD VoIP phone systems are implemented without a local session controller. The session controller may be located remotely and serve several sites by providing long local service. This implementation scenario provides for central management of the overall phone system, saves in initial implementation cost, and saves in operating costs. As such this scenario has many benefits. Unfortunately, the reality of this implementation is that in order to place a call between two endpoints within the local site or to place a call via the local commercial service connection, the initiating end instrument has to send its signal messages to the remote session controller over the DISN WAN connection, then the session controller has to signal the called instrument or media gateway over the same WAN connection. Several messages are sent (back and forth) over the WAN connection before the two local endpoints can send their media streams directly between themselves. While the need to signal over the WAN connection can cause longer call setup time which can be extended if there is congestion in the network, no call can be placed anywhere from the local site if it is cut off from its session controller. Based on this fact, and in support of maintaining viable local voice services in the event the site is cut off from its remote session controller, each physical site must maintain minimal local call control as a backup so that local intra-site and local commercial network calls can be placed. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DoD sites using the commercial network.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;Reduced to no finding when the site has a separate commercial phone system (dedicated PBX or discrete instruments) available for areas with long local service.

This is not possible in an IP/LAN based VVoIP network because the LAN infrastructure is geographically spread out to be within 100m cabling distance from each LAN endpoint. As such, the power, both primary and backup, must follow the NE to its location. Centrally located core equipment must also have a central uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The endpoints also need continuous power to maintain service. IP telephony endpoints require power to operate. This can be provided locally with a power brick (a small plug-in power adaptor/supply) and an AC outlet or can be provided by the LAN using Power Over Ethernet (POE) technologies. The UPS providing backup power to the LAN access switch can also provide backup power to the endpoint via POE if properly sized. If this is not the case, an individual UPS is required for each instrument supporting special C2 and C2 users of the proper capacity. Policy sets the minimum requirements for the backup power supplied to the VVoIP systems and the supporting LAN and VVoIP endpoints with emphasis on supporting C2 communications when primary power is lost. While this is a very valid case, it is also best practice, if not critical, to provide some level of backup power to the core systems, LAN, and endpoints that only support C2R and non-C2/admin users to support some level of reliable/survivable service, especially for emergency life-safety and security calls. NOTE: The requirement here for UPS support for C2R or Non-C2/admin users communications is negated in the event that such users have an alternate reliable means of communicating in such situations. Personal and potentially even government provided cell phones are not the answer since there are many locations in DoD facilities where they are prohibited and/or signal availability is unreliable. An alternative to this could be to put a policy and SOP into effect that requires such users to evacuate the facility to a location where the appropriate communications capability is available. The policy excerpts driving this requirement are as follows: From the UCR 5.3.1.7.5 Power Backup [Required: ASLAN – Conditional: Non-ASLAN] To meet CJCS requirements for assured services, equipment serving special C2 and C2 users must be provided with backup power. The ASLAN must meet the power requirements outlined at a minimum as follows: Special C2: The ASLAN must provide an 8-hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to special C2 users. Any ASLAN product, Core, Distribution, or Access that supplies service to the special C2 user must have an 8-hour UPS. 2. C2: The ASLAN must provide 2 hour backup capability in the event of primary power loss to C2 users. Any ASLAN product, core, distribution or access, that supplies service to the C2 user must have a 2 hour uninterruptible power system (UPS). 3. C2(R) or Non-C2: C2(R) or non-C2 users may lose telephony service in the event of a power failure. NOTE: Backup Power (Environmental). The backup power system shall have the capacity to operate environmental systems needed to sustain continuous equipment operation. Power to the environmental systems may not need to be continuous. From CJCSI 6215.01C Appendix A Enclosure C Based on the GIG MA ICD requirements associated with availability and reliability, the following requirements shall be met by IP based RTS. (a) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving Special C2 users is 0.99999 with eight hours uninterrupted power supply. (b) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users is 0.99997 with two hours uninterrupted power supply. (c) Availability requirement for equipment/software serving C2 users that are authorized to originate Routine ONLY (C2R) and non C2/admin users is 0.999 with no uninterrupted power supply. NOTE: While current DoD policy dictates that the VVoIP system as a whole only provide C2 and C2R users with specific durations of continued service during a power failure (as a cost saving measure), it is highly recommended that the entire system be provided some level of UPS. Traditional phone service is generally always available in a power failure since the endpoint or subscriber instrument is powered from the telephone switch. While there are exceptions to this regarding feature phones and some digital phones that need local power, for the most part all analog phones and others powered by the switch always work when local power is out. As noted above, VVoIP service is subject to disruption if power to the LAN infrastructure is disrupted. This can happen at various points since the LAN is a distributed (non-centralized) network. When implementing a VVoIP system without considering UPS power needs for the VVoIP controllers and endpoints as well as entire LAN, and supporting those needs with UPSs, we are reducing the availability of the telecommunications service that we are accustomed to. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Reduced or no availability and denial-of-service.

Such is the case when the system is managed by local SAs and systems via the local management VLAN or dedicated OOB management network and other SAs or systems manage or monitor the system via another network such as a remote MILDEP NOC, the DSN’s ADIMSS network, the RTS EMS, or the DISN DCN. A similar situation occurs in the DRSN with the ARDIMSS network. In some cases, these networks are interconnected such that both management networks have access to the same devices via a single management port. Each of these management networks is in reality a different enclave and as such, access and traffic between them must be filtered thus protecting each of the enclaves from compromise from one of the others. Enclaves are defined as a collection of computing environments connected by one or more internal networks under the control of a single authority and security policy, including personnel and physical security. Based on this definition, the local LAN enclave, remote MILDEP NOC, the DSN’s ADIMSS network, the RTS EMS, and the DISN DCN are different enclaves.

Unauthorized access can lead to complete corruption of the system or device, causing the loss of availability (denial-of-service), integrity, and information or communications confidentiality. As such management interfaces and the management traffic they transmit or receive must be protected. The most effective method for providing this protection is to establish a separate dedicated network for the purpose of managing systems, devices, and network elements. Such a network is typically called an out-of-band (OOB) management network. Such networks can be expensive to establish depending on the geographical placement of the managed devices. This protection can also be afforded the management interfaces and traffic on the same network as the production traffic uses, but the process is more difficult and protection requirements more stringent. This method is called In-Band management. When using in-band management, the most effective method for providing management interface and traffic protection is to establish a separate dedicated management VLAN on the production network. Another method for protecting management traffic is the use of secure protocols and encryption. The Network Infrastructure STIG defines the requirements for both in-band and OOB management. In-band management is permitted for the typically geographically disbursed network elements using a dedicated management VLAN and logically separate management interfaces on each NE. In general the management of VVoIP core systems and devices must follow the NI STIG/checklist guidance. This means that these systems/devices can be managed via an OOB management network or an in –band VLAN. While this is the case, the this management access must be segregated from all other management VLANs on the network. The purpose of the separate VVoIP management VLAN or OOB network is to provide for separation of access in support of separation of duties between the data network or server SAs and the VVoIP system SAs. In some organizations these SAs are from different departments or just have different duties that don’t require that they have access to all devices on the network.

Only the required protocols are to reach a given VVoIP device thereby protecting it from non-essential protocols. This protection is afforded on the LAN by implementing ACLs based on VLAN/subnet, protocol and in some instances specific IP addresses. While a firewall placed between the core equipment and endpoint VLANs might provide better protection for the core equipment as a whole, a router is best suited to control the varying traffic patterns between the various devices. Normally a large B/C/P/S will have a large LAN and one or more LSCs supporting a large VVoIP phone system. In this case, it is within normal network design parameters to employ routing devices at the core of the LAN within the enclave. As such, the VVoIP system’s core equipment would be connected to these routing devices or have one or more routing devices of its own. 

NOTE: It is recognized that small LANs and enclaves may not support VVoIP phone system core equipment as would be the case if they used a “managed service” or a remote LSC. In such a LAN the number of VLANs might be limited to one for data and one for VoIP. Also, a small LAN may not have a router at its core, potentially due to cost, thereby not having the capability of supporting multiple VVoIP VLANs.

These reasons are as follows: 
&gt; Most high capacity local commercial voice service (more than a few individual lines) is delivered from the carrier via TDM trunks. This requires the conversion to VoIP via a media gateway. 
&gt; The implementation or receipt of commercial VoIP service from an Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP), would require the implementation of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) connection or a connection into the service provider’s network via a VPN or dedicated TDM or optical circuit. In effect, a connection into the service provider’s network would provide a path to the Internet. These types of local connections provide a “back door” into the local network that can place the entire DISN or GIG at risk from exploitation and can circumnavigate the protections put in place by the operators of the DISN (DISA). Such connections need to be specifically approved under CJCSI 6211.02C and DODI 4640.14.  Such connections must also meet the requirements in the Network Infrastructure STIG for an “Approved Gateway.” This generally means that a full boundary architecture has to be implemented. Specific requirements for the implementation of commercial VoIP service will be defined later. NOTE: The term “back door” as used here means an illicit or UN-approved connection and is not intended to have the same meaning as the term “backdoor connection”, as defined in RFC 2764, and used in the Network Infrastructure STIG. NOTE: A PRI or CAS trunk is required because the DSN is not permitted to exchange SS7 signaling with the PSTN. Doing so would place the DoD’s SS7 network at risk. 
NOTE: The implementation of local ITSP connections to utilize commercial VoIP services at all BCPS would mean the implementation of an OSD / Gig Waiver Panel “approved ISP gateway” at each BCPS. This would amount to over 1000 direct connections between the Internet and the NIPRNet via the BCPS LAN. While these connections might be limited to VoIP only traffic, these would have the potential to be mis-configured in such a way that the connection provides an open “back door” for general access, Internet traffic, and attacks. This presents a huge risk to the DISN which is unacceptable. It is therefore highly unlikely that DoD will take such an approach and approve such connections.

We rely on these services being available when they are needed. Additionally, it is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability of maintaining the ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. While the DoD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable, such that continuity of operations (COOP) is supported, there is the potential that a site will be cut off from the DoD network. Based on this fact, each physical site must maintain local commercial phone service in the event the site is cut off. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DoD sites using the commercial network. An additional, non IA benefit is that this supports the ability to make local calls without having to pay toll charges to call a local number via some distant regional access point. Local phone service can be delivered in a number of ways, all of which meet this requirement, while some of them must meet additional requirements to secure them. 

Delivery options are as follows: 
&gt; PRI or CAS TDM trunks  
&gt; Analog phone lines The type and amount of local phone service required can also depend upon the size of the site. 

The following are some examples: 
&gt; A large site or main operating base (MOB) could use PRI or CAS TDM trunks connected to the site’s PBX. The larger the site the more trunks are used. 
&gt; A small site or geographically separate unit (GSU) attached to a MOB. 
&gt;&gt; May have a PBX and be served similar to a large site. 
&gt;&gt; May be served by several analog phone lines terminated on discrete instruments or a key system.

While this is relatively easy for data transmission, this is not an easy task for voice and video communications, particularly when the state of the art for VoIP communications today has developed along different paths followed by each vendor. As such, VoIP communications has not been interoperable between different vendor’s systems or between these systems and the various VoIP services that are available today. The task is made more difficult by the fact that the transport medium, that is IP networks, are generally not designed to transport time sensitive communications. Information contained in packets is transported in a manner that ensures the information will get to its destination reliably, although not in a specific amount of time. This is not acceptable for packetized voice and video since lost or delayed packets affects intelligibility of the communications. An additional aspect of assured service voice communications is that of call or message priority. Some calls, that are high priority C2 calls, must be completed at the expense of lower priority or routine calls. DISA has worked to overcome these issues by working with the many vendors that provide telecommunications equipment to the DoD to develop a highly available, reliable, and interoperable IP based assured service voice and video communications network to meet the needs of its C2 customers. Additional DoD policy dictates that DISN services be used as the first choice for DoD components to fulfill their long haul communications needs. For dialup voice, video, and data services the Defense Switched Network (DSN) has fulfilled this role for sensitive but unclassified communications. Similarly the Defense RED Switched Network (DRSN) has fulfilled this role for multi-level classified voice communications. 

As DoD migrates to an all IP based DISN, the IP based voice services with the addition of video will fulfill this role into the future. A single vendor, classified, secret level, IP voice communications system has been implemented on SIPRNet which is currently called VoSIP. VoSIP stands for Voice over Secret (or secure) IP. This service and the supporting network are expected to provide assured service in the future. 

For the purpose of this document, assured voice/video communications services (classified or unclassified) on the DISN is designated as DISN IP Voice Services (IPVS). 

As such, if the VVoIP system within the enclave connects to the DISN WAN for VVoIP transport between enclaves AND the system is intended to provide assured service communications between enclaves to any level of C2 user (Special C2, C2, C2(R)), the system must be integrated with (or subscribed to) the worldwide DISN IPVS network operating on the appropriately classified DISN IP WAN service.

As such, the worldwide availability and effectiveness of this service is dependant upon the components of the overall system that are located in each interconnected enclave. These components must be interoperable and support the needed quality of service. Therefore, if the VVoIP system in an enclave is to utilize the DISN IPVS to communicate with other enclaves across the NIPRNet, the system must be designed with equipment that has specific capabilities. Additionally, the implementation of VVoIP across the enclave boundary must not degrade the security or protection of the enclave. Use of the DISN IPVS network requires the following equipment such that interoperability is assured across the DISN service: &gt; One or more DOD APL listed Customer Edge Routers (CERs) on which the DISN access circuits are terminated. The CER is robust/reliable and provides QOS features / capabilities as required by the UCR for the specific type of site.

The LSC (one or more per site) manages local endpoint registration and calls established to/from local endpoints and facilities. Also manages calls into and out of the enclave. The MFSS (typically one per site) performs LSC functions for its site and provides signaling management for a regional set of LSCs. &gt; Each LSC or MFSS and CER will be separated by a firewall or session border controller having specific functionality as defined in the UCR. This DoD specific device is called an Edge Boundary Controller (EBC). This may be a dedicated device or may be a functional part of the required data firewall. The use of these devices is critical to the success of the DISN IPVS’s mission. Additionally, The typical perimeter or premise router (as designated by the NI and Enclave STIGs) will most likely not be capable of supporting the needs of VVoIP entering the DISN WAN. This is because only newer routers are capable of dealing with service classes and expedited forwarding. This why the DISN IPVS PMO specifies the specific additional capabilities required of the perimeter or premise router to support the needs of the Assures Service network. The router designated by the DISN IPVS PMO that is needed to support the service is called the Customer Edge Router (CER). This terminology is consistent with the terminology used by the DISN CORE PMO and other WAN service providers. The CER provides the following functionality: &gt; Provides minimally four expedited forwarding cues (eight may be required in the future) &gt; Places traffic within expedited forwarding cues based on the DSCP markings carried by the traffic &gt; Routes AS-SIP-TLS packets and SRTP/SRTCP packets to the EBC function.

As such, the worldwide availability and effectiveness of this service is dependant upon the components of the overall system that are located in each interconnected enclave. These components must be interoperable and support the needed quality of service. Therefore, if the VVoIP system in an enclave is to utilize the DISN IPVS to communicate with other enclaves across the NIPRNet, the system must be designed with equipment that has specific capabilities. Additionally, the implementation of VVoIP across the enclave boundary must not degrade the security or protection of the enclave. 

Use of the DISN IPVS network requires the following equipment such that interoperability is assured across the DISN service:
&gt; One or more DOD APL listed Customer Edge Routers (CERs) on which the DISN access circuits are terminated. The CER is robust/reliable and provides QOS features / capabilities as required by the UCR for the specific type of site. NOTE: the CER is the enclave’s perimeter or premise router as designated by the Network Infrastructure and Enclave STIGs.
&gt; One or more DOD APL listed Local Session Controller’s (LSCs) or Multi-Function Soft Switch (MFSS) within the enclave for session control. These are the system control and signaling agents of the system. The LSC and MFSS are robust/reliable and provide admission control, and QOS features / capabilities as required by the UCR. The LSC (one or more per site) manages local endpoint registration and calls established to/from local endpoints and facilities. Also manages calls into and out of the enclave. The MFSS (typically one per site) performs LSC functions for its site and provides signaling management for a regional set of LSCs. An MFSS is a backbone device and is only required at DISN IPVS PMO designated locations.
&gt; Each LSC or MFSS and CER will be separated by a firewall or session border controller having specific functionality as defined in the UCR. This DoD specific device is called a Edge Boundary Controller (EBC). This may be a dedicated device or may be a functional part of the required data firewall. 

The use of these devices is critical to the success of the DISN IPVS’s mission

NOTE: As noted in the LAN section, on a large facility (site) the primary LSC should have a backup LSC that is geographically separate from it. This is also applicable to a facility/site that has a MFSS. While the MFSSs work in pairs in the backbone and are therefore redundant with regard to backbone services, their LSC functionality should also be redundant.

This method includes or supports providing precedence and priority capabilities for C2 users similar to the MLPP service provided by the traditional TDM based DSN. The enclave’s internal LAN is required to be designed to be non-blocking. That is it must provide ample bandwidth for all the traffic that it is expected to carry. This is controllable by DoD. On the other hand, the DISN Core is designed to have ample bandwidth and expandability to support what ever traffic the DoD enclaves throw at it. As such it is considered to be bandwidth rich. Due to issues surrounding the ability for an attached enclave to determine the bandwidth availability or congestion conditions within the core in real time, an assumption has to be made that the DISN Core is also non-blocking. The DISN Core bandwidth is also controllable by DoD. The portion of the overall DISN network that is bandwidth constrained is the TDM or optical OCx access circuits between the local enclave and the DISN Core. This is the portion of the network where we have the least control over bandwidth availability, primarily due to the cost of these circuits. The cost factor is an issue since many DISN access circuits must rely on commercial carriers for some portion of the overall circuit. This is typically the portion that delivers the DISN service to the B/C/P/S. Access circuit issues are less of an issue if the B/C/P/S also provides a home for one of the DISN Core SDNs. This is because a direct connection can be made between the CER and the SDN, however, the circuit capacity may still be an issue if the SDN is a small one that does not have an AR or PE. Due to the nature of digital transmission over these bandwidth constrained circuits, the quality and availability of the communications is degraded as these circuits become congested. “Data” packets can wait until processed without negatively affecting the delivery of a message. This is not the case for VVoIP due to its time sensitive nature (it is a real time service). If VVoIP packets have to wait for transmission, the quality of the call suffers. In IA terms, this relates to the availability of the service and quality communications. To overcome the bandwidth constraints inherent in WAN access circuits, an engineered bandwidth budget must be developed for each service (voice, video, and data) using the circuit. Voice and video budgets are developed in terms of call or session counts. For example, the UCR defines a voice call as follows: “One voice session budget unit shall be equivalent to 110 kilobits per second (kbps) of access circuit bandwidth independent of the EI codec used. This includes ITUT Recommendation G.711 encoding rate plus Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) packet overhead plus ASLAN Ethernet overhead. IPv6 overhead, not IPv4 overhead, is used to determine bandwidth equivalents here.” 

NOTE: This budget is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. 

NOTE: The VoIP budget covers the following types of services: Voice VoIP, FoIP, MoIP, or SCIP over IP calls The UCR also defines a video call as follows: “Since the bandwidth of a video session can vary [depending upon video resolution (ed)], video sessions will be budgeted in terms of video session units (VSUs). One VSU equals 500 kbps and bandwidth for video sessions will be allocated in multiples of VSUs. For example, the bandwidth allocated to video sessions may be 500 kbps, 1000 kbps, and 2500 kbps. Thus, a video session that requires 2500 kbps will be allocated five VSUs.” 

NOTE: This discussion, as it relates to video, is in regard to video sessions controlled by the LSC using AS-SIP for the signaling protocol. H.323 signaled video and/or VTC sessions must be considered separately and potentially have their own budget for access circuit bandwidth. 

NOTE: This budget (which also includes the audio component) is unidirectional and must be doubled for bi-directional communications sessions. When developing the bandwidth budgets, the engineer must determine how many simultaneous voice and video calls/sessions are to be supported by the access circuit based upon the unit per call defined in the UCR. The bandwidth budget to be reserved for voice is then calculated along with a budget for video. Next the engineer must determine what percentage of the overall access circuit bandwidth these reserved budgets should consume. The access circuit is then sized (ordered) to accommodate the needs. It is not recommended that IP voice and video capabilities be added to an existing circuit since this would mean the call/session counts would have to be restricted or the data budget would have to be squeezed. 

NOTE: Data traffic is permitted to surge into the voice and video budgets if the bandwidth is available; however the voice and video budgets are reserved and will be reclaimed if needed. Voice and video is not permitted to surge into the data budget since ASAC needs a fixed call count to be effective. 

NOTE: Instructions for determining voice call budgets for a DISN WAN access circuit can be found in the UCR section 5.3.3.11 Provisioning

The reliability, redundancy, and robustness of the CER, SBC, and power source are subverted when the facility represents a single point of failure. For a small number of C2 users this may be less concerning but with more C2 users supported by the system, the greater the issue. Even less severe eventualities may limit the capability of the system to support reliable communications. 

The mitigation for this system wide vulnerability is to implement redundant facilities to which the geographically diverse pathways containing the dual homed access circuits can run and terminate on redundant, geographically separated sets of CERs, SBCs, and core LAN equipment. Session controllers can also be separated in this manner. This mitigation is costly and facilities housing critical communications infrastructure are not lost very often. However, the cost of mitigating this vulnerability must be weighed against the loss of critical communications, particularly in time of crisis. If the site supports large numbers of high level C2 users or special-C2 users, the cost of losing communications may outweigh the cost of providing redundant facilities. Another consideration should be access to emergency services via the communications system would also be lost. 

The threat to strategic facilities is greater from natural causes than from damage due to acts of war or terrorism. However, all threats must be considered. Tactical facilities have a higher vulnerability to acts of war, on a par with or exceeding the vulnerability posed by natural events.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1, ECSC-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20303r3_fix">Implement and document critical network equipment as redundant and in geographically diverse locations for a site supporting C2 users.

When additional services for SIP trunks are necessary, an ITSP may provide an “alternate connection” but this requires approval by the DoDIN Waiver Panel and signature by the DoD CIO. Local ISP connections provide an Internet pathway into the DISN, placing the DoDIN directly at risk for exploitation. A local ISP connection can circumnavigate DoD protections of the DISN at its boundaries with the Internet. Using commercial VoIP service from an ITSP requires the implementation of an internet service provider (ISP) connection, potentially providing a path to the Internet. These types of connections must be approved and must meet the requirements in the Network Infrastructure STIG (NET0160) for an Internet Access Point (IAP).

ITSP connections may provide SIP trunks terminating on a media gateway, which then provides TDM trunks or POTS lines to traditional non-VoIP PBX, key system, or individual end instrument. ITSP connections terminating in a separate LAN from the enclave’s DoD LAN may support a separate VoIP system. This connection type might be used for a small site having a small VoIP system or a few discrete phones dedicated to commercial network calling. 

Additional guidance for the selection and procurement of telecommunications services is discussed in the DoDI 8100.4 "DoD Unified Capabilities (UC)" dated 9 Dec 2010 and the DoD Unified Capabilities Requirements 2013 (UCR 2013) documents.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;EBCR-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-20305r3_fix">Obtain approval by the DoDIN Waiver Panel and signature by the DOD CIO for a permanent “alternate connection” to the ITSP for any connection with a commercial VoIP provider (ITSP).</fixtext><fix id="F-20305r3_fix" /><check system="C-23890r2_chk"><check-content-ref name="M" href="DPMS_XCCDF_Benchmark_VVoIP STIG Policy.xml" /><check-content>Inspect the VVoIP implementation system design for connections to commercial VoIP ITSP.

Data exfiltration presents a huge vulnerability to any data that is stored within any enterprise and especially sensitive data. The DoD’s data is no less vulnerable. While predominantly an insider threat at this time, as EoIP technology progresses, the bad actors will find external methods to get at and exfiltrate our data through this covert channel that does not require insider activities. 

The traditional pathway to exploit this vulnerability is via a modem and the traditional voice network. The modem was invented to transfer data via the traditional telephone system. A modem can easily be connected to a phone line and a server or workstation (if not already embedded,), a outbound call can be made to an external computer’s modem, and data can flow easily, albeit slowly. To mitigate this threat, we institute both policy and technological mitigations such as specifically authorizing modem use; disabling an embedded modem while its host is connected to a computer network, and others. While modem usage for day-to-day data transfers and network access is dwindling at the enterprise level, many devices today still require the use of a modem. These are FAX machines, traditional secure telephones, and traditional secure VTC systems.  As part of a layered defense against enterprise data exfiltration via a modem; detection, filtering, blocking, and call admission control mechanisms can be placed on traditional telephone switch trunks to detect unauthorized modem traffic and take appropriate action. Generally speaking, all modem traffic should be blocked with permissions established for pre-authorized devices on a specific line-by-line, case-by-case basis. Such technologies exist today.

Today’s technology is taking us swiftly toward a totally converged IP based data and communications network. This can be referred to as Everything over IP (EoIP). As this trend continues the many vulnerabilities and threats that we have been dealing with for years on our data networks are extended to our voice and video communications networks. The threat of sensitive enterprise data exfiltration via the data network is nothing new, and mitigations have been developed to address the various methods and exploits. However, little or nothing has been done to date to address the covert channel through our VoIP communications infrastructure whether connected to a traditional telephone network via a Media Gateway (MG), or to an IP WAN via a Session Border Controller (SBC), or Edge Border Controller (EBC). VVoIP aware firewalls generally address signaling issues and vulnerabilities, but do little to address those of the media streams. 

A data exfiltration exploit using the VVoIP network would look something like this. A trusted insider places a VoIP call from a compromised soft-phone on their workstation to a collection server outside the enterprise network. The call is processed and routed by the VoIP session manager as it would any voice call. The collection server answers the call as if it was a VoIP endpoint; e.g., using another compromised soft-phone. Once the connection is established, a file transfer can occur using the normal RTP streams established for the call as the transport medium. The data transfer is not detected because RTP or SRTP streams are generally not inspected. This is because of a general perception that payload anomalies are undetectable due to the random nature of encoded audio and video signals. SRTP encryption makes the payload inspection task even harder. This scenario easy to implement via IP end to-end-through one or more SBCs/EBCs without any data degradation.  While it has been commonly thought that the transcoding performed in a MG would prevent such an exploit, such an exploit has been demonstrated using a pair of MGs resulting in only minor data degradation. Due to this fact, it is time to be concerned about data exfiltration via the VVoIP infrastructure and implement mitigations to prevent it. 


Today we employ various mitigations that serve to inhibit data exfiltration exploits via VVoIP such as described above. These include but are not limited to the following: 
&gt; Restricting what software can be installed on a server or workstation 
&gt; Restricting what that software can do
&gt; Restricting user to data
&gt; Restricting machine and user access to the network via port security and user authentication
&gt; As well as others

As an additional part of a layered defense against enterprise data exfiltration via the VVoIP network, is to place filters at the VVoIP network egress points, (that is at the MGs and at or within the SBCs/EBCs) that can detect data flows and other anomalies in a RTP/SRTP media stream. Today this is an emerging technology with initial capabilities available today. It is expected that this technology will more robust and mature in the not too distant future.

Support for enhanced emergency services communications by private MLTS is left to state legislation. Several states have such legislation today while more states are on the way. Eventually, most, if not all, states will likely have such legislation. Additionally, with respect to the DoD, DoDI 6055.06, DoD Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) Program, December 21, 2006, provides DoD policy regarding emergency services and emergency services communications. While much of this policy addresses fire protection in general and more specifically training, staffing, and equipment, it also provides for telecommunications support for fire, medical, and security emergencies, whether directly or by implication. Several items of interest for this and subsequent STIG requirements are as follows: &gt; 5.8. The Combatant Commanders, through Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall ensure F&amp;ES protection of personnel, equipment, and facilities. &gt; 6.6. Telecommunication Capability. Implement around-the-clock capability to conduct dedicated F&amp;ES communications. &gt; E8.1 Telecommunication Capability; Maintain around-the-clock capability to conduct essential F&amp;ES communications. &gt; E8.1.2. The DoD Components shall implement the installation F&amp;ES alarm and communication function where feasible. &gt; E8.1.2.1. Consolidate with an established continuously manned emergency communications center for all emergency services. &gt; E8.1.2.4. DoD F&amp;ES communications and dispatch functions may be provided by municipal F&amp;ES or other outside agencies when those agencies compare favorably with DoD standards and can meet the prescribed communications criteria. Private telephone systems, in general, provide a large portion of the required telecommunication capability. All DoD telecommunications systems are private MLTS. As such, ALL private MLTS, VoIP or traditional must support enhanced emergency services communications for the completion of emergency calls. Per DoDI 6055.06, all sites must support, provide for, and implement F&amp;ES telecommunications services. When implementing basic F&amp;ES telecommunications services, each country or region designates a specific standard telephone number or prefix code to be dialed that can be easily remembered by the public. In some instances, while not best practice, organizations might designate an internal emergency number for use within their MLTS. PSTN LECs and CLECs must route calls to this number in a non-blocking priority manner. Examples of such numbers are as follows: &gt; 911 in North America &gt; 112 in the EU and UK &gt; 000 in Australia In some cases countries use a separate code for Police vs Medical vs Fire. A rather comprehensive listing can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number. Issues arise when an emergency call is originated through a private phone system, such as a traditional PBX or a VVoIP system. While the LEC or CLEC may properly route the call in a priority manner, the same may not be true for the private system unless specificity addressed in the systems call routing tables and potentially other system features. This is an issue when providing emergency communications services as a best practice or in compliance with governmental mandate. As such, the private system must be configured to properly handle emergency communications. Enhanced F&amp;ES communications permits the answering station to automatically locate the caller. This is particularly helpful when the caller cannot provide their location themselves. Enhanced F&amp;ES communications is generally mandated by the FCC and state legislation. It is today’s state of the art and its implementation is a best practice. The enhanced F&amp;ES communications capability is enabled using Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and Automatic Location Identification (ALI) information. ANI provides the telephone number of the calling party and is generated by the telephone system/switch. ALI associates the calling party’s number (ANI information) with their address, or registered the address/location of the phone being used. ALI is provided by a database function. The database may be maintained within the telephone system/switch or externally. In many cases, the F&amp;ES answering service system will use the ALI information to map the location of the calling phone. ALI information in the public sector is maintained by the telephone service providers and is generally based on billing records. This works fine for traditional phones that have a fixed location at the end of a telephone company wire. VoIP phones, on the other hand, can be connected anywhere in the world and function. This is an issue for commercial VoIP services which is being addressed by the FCC. ALI information in the private sector must be handled by the owners/operators of private MLTS. If a private MLTS is to support enhanced F&amp;ES telecommunications, an ALI database must be instituted and maintained current as instruments and numbers move around a facility or site. While, in many cases, this may be a manual task, automated systems are being developed. NOTE: Notwithstanding system configuration and capabilities, the system must also remain fully functional, minimally for a reasonable time period, in the event primary power is lost. As such, both traditional PBXs and VVoIP systems along with their supporting LAN infrastructure must be provided with sufficient backup power. Specific requirements for voice communications system backup power are addressed in additional requirements. &lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;None&lt;/SeverityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;Loss of life, loss of personal and/or facility safety or security, loss of the facility.&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Officer&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Information Assurance Manager&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;Other&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;DCBP-1&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description><reference><dc:title>DPMS Target IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:title><dc:publisher>DISA</dc:publisher><dc:type>DPMS Target</dc:type><dc:subject>IP Voice/Video/UC Site / System</dc:subject><dc:identifier>594</dc:identifier></reference><fixtext fixref="F-22297r1_fix">Ensure the site provides for the local DoD Multi-Line Telecommunications System (MLTS), VoIP or traditional, and supports enhanced Fire and Emergency Services (F&amp;ES) telecommunications as follows:

These URLs are translated to IP addresses by a DNS server. The use of URLS in this manner permits an endpoint to find the server it is looking for in the event the server’s IP address is changed. This also permits the endpoint to locate its assigned or home call controller from a remote location on a network that is not their home network. While all of this adds flexibility to the system and the endpoint’s location, it also exposes the endpoint and the home system to DNS vulnerabilities. Additionally, the home VVoIP system must expose critical IP address and domain information to the DNS system. If the DNS system is exposed to the DNS servers that support the enterprise data network or the Internet, this information and exposure of the system is, or may be, extended to the world. This provides information that can be used to attack or compromise the VVoIP system. 

When using DNS within a VVoIP system so that endpoints can find various servers in the network, the DNS server should be dedicated to the VVoIP system. Further more this DNS server should have limited or no interaction with the DNS server used by the data portion of the LAN/CAN or a publicly accessible DNS server. This will protect the VVoIP system’s DNS server from some of the vulnerabilities inherent in DNS servers that serve data endpoints and that are connected to the wider enterprise networks or the Internet.

While the use of DNS adds IP addressing flexibility to a VVoIP system, it is not necessary to use it for systems within the local LAN. VVoIP servers and infrastructure devices are required to be statically addressed. Therefore the endpoints can be configured with these known IP addresses rather than URLs. A remote endpoint is required to connect to the home enclave via a VPN. It receives an internal LAN address and therefore becomes a part of the LAN and can directly reach its servers using their IP address. A URL is not required. The only time a URL might be required is in the event the endpoint is required to find a server such as a directory server that is somewhere on the WAN. This is the case in the VoSIP system on SIPRNet. Not using DNS in a VVoIP system eliminates its exposure to DNS vulnerabilities and attacks effected using information obtained from the DNS. 

NOTE: In the event a DNS server is implemented within the VVoIP system, the DNS STIG must be applied to the server.

The Network Infrastructure STIG provides guidance for using NTP and implementing NTP servers within the enclave or LAN. A paraphrased summary of the basic requirements follows:
&gt; Implement two NTP servers in the LAN management network to act as the source of NTP information to the rest of the enclave/LAN.
&gt; Reference the two NTP servers to two different stratum 1 reference clocks via GPS or NIST WWVB.
&gt; Harden NTP servers in accordance with the applicable OS STIG.

NOTE: This list is not complete and is provided as information only. Refer to the current Network Infrastructure STIG for all policy and requirements associated with NTP use and implementation in the LAN. 

The VVoIP system must be synchronized with the LAN time, minimally to support troubleshooting and incident response. Therefore the VVoIP system must be integrated into the LAN’S NTP system in accordance with the Network Infrastructure STIG NTP guidance. Its network time must not be synchronized with an independent source. 

Additionally, if the VVoIP system is synchronized with an independent source via the Internet, the VVoIP system becomes exposed to NTP exploits and attacks from the Internet.

Implementing NTP within the VVoIP system will require the system/call controller to be configured to receive authenticated NTP messages from the two NTP server IP addresses via its management interface. This will require that permissions be granted between the VVoIP management VLAN and the LAN management VLAN such that NTP requests and responses can flow between the VVoIP system controller and the two NTP servers in the LAN management VLAN. If the VVoIP endpoints time is synchronized via NTP, the VVoIP controller will have to serve as their NTP server since the endpoints do not have access to the VVoIP or LAN management VLANs and should not be permitted such access.
